# Basic Bot was created by Habchy#1665
# Please join this Discord server if you need help: https://discord.gg/FNNNgqb
# Please modify the parts of the code where it asks you to. Example: The Prefix or The Bot Token
# This is by no means a full bot, it's more of a starter to show you what the python language can do in Discord.
# Thank you for using this and don't forget to star my repo on GitHub! [Repo Link: https://github.com/Habchy/BasicBot]

# The help command is currently set to be not be Direct Messaged.
# If you would like to change that, change "pm_help = False" to "pm_help = True" on line 9.
