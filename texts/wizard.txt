WIZARD

They came in flocks from the skies. They blotted out the moon as they flooded down like a black wave onto the fresh grave of Icha the Wizard. They dug ferociously, with an abnormal strength that no bird should ever be able to possess, some of their thin necks cracking and snapping like dry twigs as they thrust and thrust, deeper and deeper toward the buried corpse of Icha the Wizard. For this was the prize they sought so desperately, they sought to unearth the dead wizard's body and then to carry it high over the mountains and fields to the place where Elevefron the Wizard, their master, Icha's enemy in life, did wait.

The birds, after many deaths of their own, finally reached the box that contained Icha. They pulled and pulled, and the lid on his coffin slowly, with great effort, creaked open to reveal Icha still clad in his beautiful, breathtaking wizard's robe of crimson satin. At this sight, all the birds, in a mad frenzy, flew into the darkness of the grave, and they smothered Icha, for during his life they had despised his evil wizardry.

But to their surprise and horror, from Icha's rotting, gaping mouth, a deformed, two-headed, feline-like creature did emerge to meet them, and furthermore, to bring their terror to an ultimate crescendo. The coffin lid slammed shut with an unerring force and trapped the whole mass of now doomed, terrified blackbirds within the darkness of Icha's grave.

Much later, a partial silence did reign in the dark graveyard, apart only from the spasmodic, hysterical, whooping laughter, which drifted from the dark grave of Icha the Wizard as he and his two-headed feline friend fed most heartily upon the dead, defeated blackbirds.
