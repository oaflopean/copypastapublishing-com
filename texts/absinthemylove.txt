ABSINTHE MY LOVE

Eyes that swoon and sway, 
Mind stolen by hardship and pain.
Thoughts flit and float just beyond grasp on the tip of my brain.
I focus on hope but clarity evaporates like a wraith at sunrise. 

Red pyre burning bright, leaves shrivel and crackle in moonlight, 
Mouth poised with anticipation. 
Absinthe coats my throat freeing my mind with pleasure. 
The emerald fairy flirts and flies
Taunting me with glimpses of divine obscurity.

Heavenly droplets bead and run in rivulets to my soul
Lifting my spirits with every draught;
My tongue loosens the fettles of reality, 
Every flavour unleashing torrents of thoughts awakening my mind
Seasoning perception with perfection.

My heart gloating, steeped in blissful eccentricity
Pulse racing, ideas coursing in streams before my minds eye.
I am immortal! None may touch me!!!
I growl and roar like a man possessed 
Eyes bulging, heart racing, chest heaving
My life's spark leaves my throat, soars higher and higher past the clouds into the void beyond.
