SERPENT SPIRIT

Darkness fell quickly, like a lush, black, velvet carpet unfolding itself across an extraordinarily clear, blue sky. Hungry birds circled and fed greedily off the rotting, bloody corpse, picking and pulling at the dead meat, enjoying and savouring this unexpected, salty-flavoured feast.

Abruptly, the deafening silence surrounding these hungry, feathered beasts was torn to shreds by a wailing and chanting that emanated and drifted down in fearful waves from the now gloomy skies.

"Sol-Icky, Sol-Icky be saved," the booming voices proclaimed in chanting unison, and immediately a crimson slash appeared across the belly of darkness, and like the parting of the waves, the skies were torn asunder. Far below, the corpse's empty eye sockets wept blood, as if with joy.

Scarlet rain poured through the gaping wound in the skies, and the Sol-Icky serpent spirit, the dark one the gods were now calling home, unwound himself from within the gaping mouth of his dismembered shell. Up and up the serpent then sped to smash through the bloody rain toward the passage that now lay embedded within this dark, turbulent sea of a sky. On the way to his beloved home, Sol-Icky shrieked with joy and excitement - a sound very much like an eagle's scream erupting from his vicious-looking maw.

Once home, Sol-Icky was presented with row upon row of kneeling spirits, who had been left as a special homecoming present, and like the birds in the stinking world far below, Sol-Icky would now feed, feed with an elation so strong within his black serpent-spirit he thought he might very well explode with joy and sustenance.
