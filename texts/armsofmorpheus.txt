ARMS OF MORPHEUS

Life sings sweetly in my ear, 
A melody as rich as I could ever hear,
"I know that I will feel my final gasp 
All too soon, it's there waiting."
I have come to know death's gentle grasp
A sonorous tap reminds me my end is near
just around the corner, out of sight. 

My eyes look in wonder at the beauty around 
Even light has a viscous richness 
I have only just seen. 
My breath comes that little more slowly 
Anger has departed only sadness remains. 
She sings a song of Sorrow 
A lament that I know all too well. 

My heart has begun its final journey 
Death and I are acquainted now.
In Morpheus's soft arms I dream I'm flying, 
high above in the mountains clear
My wife and children laughing beside me 
I feel happiness and glee.  

A bird of fire takes me up 
Soaring higher and higher in her wings
I'm carried away on the summer breeze 
Happy at last.
