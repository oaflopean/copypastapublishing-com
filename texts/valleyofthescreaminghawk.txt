VALLEY OF THE SCREAMING HAWK

Deep within the Valley of the Screaming Hawk, ancient, gnarled trees whisper of the night's devilish scenes, and eerie cackles and whoops of utter derision, like spirits, drift gently on the wind. Animals, this night, stand statue-like, struck dumb with fear.

The trees, they whisper of naked devils that dance around them in the deep of the night, devils that sing and rejoice and then enter a coma-like sleep for hour upon hour.

But what the ancient trees did not behold, that which is, as yet, hidden from all reality, is the activity going on within the demons' cesspool minds. They wallow in lakes of crimson blood, and slowly emerging from these lakes of blood, like a phoenix rising out of the ashes before them, a huge, horned god, who breathes streams and great gouts of fire into which the devils shriek and drool, immersing themselves within the beautiful pain of the flames, which lap and lick.

Aroused now, massively stimulated by the arrival of their horned god, their dreams grow fleshy, real, bubbling, gushing, out of their nostrils, out of their open mouths--spouting replicas of the great horned god.

Hundreds upon hundreds of winged devils glide effortlessly through the deep, dark Forests of the Screaming Hawk. Devils born from the dreams of devils, they wreak havoc. The good gods, far above the swirling clouds, stare at the scene, and stare through misty eyes clouded with tears, through sad, normally laughing eyes, for they know the longest night of Planet Earth has arrived with a vengeance.

A new Night Land has been born, for the flying multitudes of devils, like parasites, have surrounded the sun. They greedily feed off and then extinguish the solar flames, thus permanently sending Planet Earth into total and complete, umbra darkness.

Night Land, oh Night Land, now reigns forever.
