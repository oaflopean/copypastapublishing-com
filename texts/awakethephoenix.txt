AWAKE THE PHOENIX

One day on wings of a fiery Phoenix 
I will soar high above the plains of despair.

One day my eyes will lift heavenward and see the blue sky above for what it is, 
Not what it might be.

One day peace will reign transcendent in my tortured soul,
Drawing pain from deep within like a needle draws pus from an abscess.

I await that day, every second, every minute, every working hour cries out 
"Rescue me from this misery; free my tortured soul!"

Let me soar high above the plains of despair on wings of fire. 
Let my eyes that have seen pain and suffering, burn with passion renewed!

Is there hope? 
Perhaps my love for those very moments that nourish my soul will return.

A promise haunts me! In my mind's eye I still see the fiery Phoenix ablaze, 
Its eyes burning bright amongst the flames that surround it. 

A furnace of fire that speaks of passion, awe and love.
Whilst others watch in fear and aspiration. 

But the fires have long since burnt out, 
The Phoenix is dead, its ashes cooled.

The fire that once had sustained me becomes a painful memory, 
A tragedy of numbness and ice ensues.

Awake!
Rise again O Phoenix!

Draw yourself from the depths of death and ignite in flame!
I summon Thee!
