DEMON DREAMS   

A piece for you. A piece for your friend.
Taste my brain, taste my essence and dream.
Dream of the darkness, 
Dream of the demons that plague me, 
Dream of the demons that torture me, 
That remorselessly piss on my grave.
Taste my brain, 
Taste my pain, 
Taste the shit that pumps around my very being.

That's my star, the one that shines blood red. 
Cut it open with jagged knife. 
Let it bleed and pull me free
From the umbilical threaded cord of dying stars.
And let me fly, 
Let me be free. 
But please don't let the demons dance with me,
Don't let them court me, and don't let them piss on my grave.

And as I vomit my forgiveness into your hands, you smile, 
You smile your crooked smile, your hungry smile, and you devour me. 
You devour my body, 
You devour my soul,
And finally but most satisfyingly, 
You devour the demons that darkly squirm from 
Within me in a stinking, slime ridden wave of fear.
