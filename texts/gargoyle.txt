GARGOYLE

Emerald eyes burning holes through my soul, 
Feelings of watching creeping terror. 
Stone heart standing out of sight. 
Evil spirits flee, jagged fingernails ripe with deceit prizing secrets from my eyes. 
Secrets drop from my mind like beads of sweat from my nose. 

Mushrooms of Angel dust reaped from the depths of Beltane hues. 
A dagger of burning truth steals a kiss. 
Ripping through my chest, exposing the expanse of my desire. 
Angel heart, burning fire, cauterising flesh, Sin destroyed. 
Fear and torment petrified.
