DEMON

Leathery-winged 
Gleaming, sapphire blue eyes 
Wicked, dagger-like teeth ideal for ripping and tearing 
Hooked talons coated with a sticky, scarlet-coloured substance 
Fur the colour of night. 

Behold for here before you stands Satan's subject
A beast of your darkest dreams. 
So sleep sleep and no need to search
For here the demon will sit before you
Coated in a glorious robe of grandeur.
