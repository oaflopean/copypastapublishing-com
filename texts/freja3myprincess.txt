FREJA: 3. MY PRINCESS

Over dark pools streaked with crimson, dragonflies, whirl and twirl,
Glimmering and glittering like precious jewels.
Glimmering and glittering forming a living crown on her pale brow.

Feathers of darkness flutter down and down 
Covering her emaciated body in a soft cloak the colour of jet.
And tears, her tears are tears of blood. 
Dripping and trickling tainting the calmness of the mill pond with the essence of her.

The girl that once laughed, the girl that once was a shining star, 
The girl who had dreams and aspirations, the girl whose life is draining away, 
Alone, alone and into nothingness.

But cry blood no longer my love, cry blood no longer, 
For soon enough the warmth and golden colour
Of the sun will seep across the meadows and across your vulnerable body, 
Gently cloaking and caressing you in it's golden finery.

And when the time is right my love, you will be led to your throne amongst the stars.
Where your head will be adorned with a colourful crown of dragonflies,
Your body will be finely cloaked in dark feathers, laced with golden sunlight.

And here my Princess you will be seated, seated and at peace 
Within the glorious heavenly Kingdom,
Where your soul will everlastingly reign forevermore.
