BLOOD FLOWER

Once upon a time, in a land permanently shrouded by darkness and totally barren of all living beings, gorgeously-scented, beautifully elegant, scarlet-coloured demon flowers swayed gently within a death-scented breeze.

The flowers had grown strong, almighty, from the blood of the humans they had slain. Their strong grimy roots sucked and sucked at the bloodless, entangled corpses that lay about them in piles, for victory was now theirs.

Their petals grew fleshier, bright red in colour, and they slowly took on the very appearance of the faces of their grimacing victims, who they had drained dry of all life-giving blood. The eerie echo of the dying moans and screams of the slain humans, now emanated from the flowers themselves, and their petals and stems throbbed gently to a slow, strong internal rhythm.

Demon flowers now covered the ruined temples, pyramids, and shrines of this ancient land in a glorious, luscious scarlet. They had virtually smothered the whole land in a spectacular, breathtaking tidal wave of crimson.

The humanoid dead now sprouted these flowers from every orifice: the flowers grew from empty eye sockets and from gaping, silently screaming mouths.

The flowers had conquered the humanoids, and now they would thrive. They would sing their ancient songs and wish and wait patiently for the resurrection of their dark master.

However, some of them did feel remorse for the pitiful, stupid humans, for the flowers had been nurtured and, to a certain extent, looked after quite well by the creatures, but water alone was no sustenance for the demon flower--blood was what they had always sought, and now they had drunk that precious liquid in quantity.

This was the first of the distant lands they planned to conquer. Soon, more and more planets would fall to the demon flower, and the new lands soon would be submerged within a mass of bloody-coloured demon flowers.
