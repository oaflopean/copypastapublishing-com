AN UNSPOKEN LOVE

Love unspoken, unnamed, yet true. 
Heart yearns, groping in darkness for a finger unfurled;
Her hand is there. 
Softness and warmth, seeking fulfilment; 
A touch, a glimmer of latent love emerges.  
At that delightful moment, a breath yet could be a thousand lifetimes;
A fire fairy deftly skipping and dancing making my fingers and spirit yearn. 
An interlude of passion seeks to burn away a lifetime of monochrome sorrow, 
If I let it.. Dare I let it?

My heart is warm, its soft fingers reaching out to embrace. 
We hold hands, words are lost here, no longer needed but not forgotten. 
Time drifts seamlessly but with purpose, 
Hugging me warmly in this place of happiness.  
Dare I speak love, dare I let it warm my heart of stone?

Speak the gentle words of love, name it so! 
My broken spirit enlivened with the small spark of immortality,
Becomes enriched with hopefulness. 
Desperate embrace my hands eagerly searching to entwine 
But she is gone. 
A phantasm of my dreams sent to destroy. 
Love flows from my broken heart, 
My eyes downcast as I settle to a life-fallorn.
