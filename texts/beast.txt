BEAST

A dragon silhouetted against a golden sunset
a beastly shadow it cast
a monster in our presence
a monster I see
a terrifying beast of vast proportions
sits before me
and stares
and stares
with eyes the colour of its past victims' blood.

And a breath of death
wafts over me
and makes me swoon and giddy
my bowels loosen with utmost fear
and with a voice shivering and shaking with terror
I speak
"Fear not, beastly dragon
for we fear and respect thee
take what you will
and pray leave us be."
