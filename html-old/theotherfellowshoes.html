<p> Hale Cambridge heard movement, not with the clear intensity of his anima senses, but with the muffled imprecision of physical ears.</p><p>        It’s a dream, he thought.  It’s all a dream.  I am integrated with my body just waiting for the seizure to wear off.  Then I’ll get up and eat and maybe sleep a little while before I head for home.  But somehow he couldn’t believe that.  These sounds were not the distorted hallucinations of retreating seizure.  These were wrong somehow—foreign, and he could not tell why.</p><p>Cambridge cautiously felt through his bio-systems.  They seemed intact and functioning but they felt wrong.  Perhaps something had gone wrong and with Ship’s life support systems.</p><p>The thought raised a gleam of panic in him.  Perhaps something had gone wrong and his anima-self was not properly integrated with his waiting body!  His panic burst into flame as he remembered the horror stories of epi-phenomenal observers unable to return to their corporeal existence.  Life support kept their bodies alive, but if the delay in re-integration was too long they sometimes awoke to screaming insanity as though their bodies were prisons from which they wanted only to be loosed.  It was a chance the epi-observers accepted from the beginning in exchange for fortunes that could be extracted from planets they had explored.  Astral Inc. had done all that could be done for their epi-observers by placing them in institutions, but none ever returned to sanity.  In truth, the only thing that could be done then was to pull the plugs to grant them merciful death.</p><p>These thoughts made Cambridge even more panicky.  Here there was no one to pull the plugs to grant him that mercy.  Like all epi-observers he had traveled to his destination alone, to explore alone, and reap all the profits alone, supported only by his custom designed ship.</p><p>Whoa, Haley.  Whoa, he thought, after a moment of blind terror.  Slow down.  Panic and you’re dead for sure.  Slow and easy! He drew in several deep breaths and began to picture his panic so as to be able to control it.  He visualized the unreasoning fear as a green, untreated prickle-ball, the spines still flexible and not poisoned.  In his mind he slowly closed his hand on the ball, folding the spines slowly, containing them until he could feel the lump of fear but no more stabbing panic.</p><p>A prickle-ball? He thought, suddenly realizing he had never seen a poisoned prickle-ball until Astral Inc. had sent him to observe Planet 4368227.  The natives, insect like creatures he called Centaur Bugs, used treated prickly seed casings from a certain type of tree as ammunition for their slings.</p><p>Why would I picture a prickle-ball? He thought.</p><p>There seemed to be more vitality in his body now, as though the drug induced epileptic seizure were relaxing and he was waking.  That did more to relieve his anxiety than anything else.</p><p>“It was a dream,” he breathed, trying to feel relief, but something sounded odd about that too.  His voice, though it would probably be croaky from disuse and seizure, shouldn’t sound like this.</p><p>Cambridge opened his eyes.</p><p>Multiple facets blurred and flicked through telescopic, middle, and close ranges then back to telescopic in a vertiginous whirl which fanned the previously controlled panic in him to infernal heat.  Cambridge gave in to it.  Slamming his eyes shut he gave himself over to unreasoning paralyzing animal terror.</p><p>After a few moments the cowering reasonable part of him re-asserted itself and he slowly pushed the panic back to control.  It took a while but finally when he could reason again he began a calm search through his body, or what was serving as his body, looking closely for things that differed from what he knew his bio-systems should be.</p><p>A different kind of eyes for sure, he thought, and shuddered.  The slight movement brought awareness that his body, or whatever, was restrained.  He tried to move his arms and found that complete muscle control was returning fast.  But the arm also came against a restraint.  A few centimeters of movement was all he could manage.</p><p>Cambridge’s bio-system check showed several things, which seemed strange, but all seemed to be functioning properly.  That was a major part of the alien-ness.  Everything worked but there were systems he simply did not understand!  He considered opening his eyes again to get some plain empirical evidence, but he remembered the last time and decided to put that off for a while.</p><p>Ok Haley, think back.  What happened?</p><p>He remembered clearly landing and burrowing his ship into camouflage in the blue-green jungle floor.  He remembered preparing to make his observations and several days of observations of the insect-like creatures of this world.  He had begun calling them Centaur Bugs the first day because they looked rather like grasshoppers with their front halves turned up like Centaurs of ancient myth.  The height of the turned up front was generally a little shorter than a standing human.  They had a well developed if primitive society and language.  Ship was still analyzing that…</p><p>Language.  Something to do with language…</p><p>Cambridge felt he was close to remembering what had happened, but there seemed to be a large blank. Something blotted out, as though with spilled black ink.  A black sea wave…</p><p>He remembered!  And the memory caused him to lurch upright trying to run, only to find the restraints holding him down.</p><p>It had been on the last day.  Haley had gone out for a final look into the hatcheries of the colony closest to ship.  He had been pulled up short by sight of several Centaur Bugs painted in camouflage colors fleeing through the jungle.  Camouflage evoked the idea of war and Haley had thus far, not seen any such thing in his observations.  There had been a guard class who keep the cultivated fields free of the ape like creatures that robbed the trees, but this appeared to be war between to tribes of the same species.  The camouflaged Bugs were fleeing through the jungle with non-camouflaged bugs brandishing swords and parry rods chasing them.  As they ran they trilled like cicadas gone mad.</p><p>The unpainted war party had caught the others and after a short fight the camouflaged creatures and surrendered.  The victors had ceremoniously slaughtered them and, with a tenderness even Cambridge recognized, prepared them for cremation along with their own fallen comrades.  The victors gathered around the improvised funeral pyre and began a kind of chant as the flames consumed the bodies.</p><p>An echo of that chant reverberated through Cambridge’s mind now.  Rising.  Falling. Compelling, magnetic rhythm which drew him closer and closer to the pyre before he realized he was being drawn.  He had struggled to be free of the power of it but the battle was lost almost before it began.  His anima was pulled into one of the Centaur Bugs! The last thing he remembered was the realization of being absorbed into the creature with unstoppable force.</p><p>That’s where I am now, Cambridge thought, holding his revulsion in check.  I’m integrated with the Centaur Bug.  I am so thoroughly absorbed now that his concepts are beginning to be mine.</p><p>But if I am here, where is his anima?  Did I shove him out all together?</p><p>No. Probably not, but then where was the other life force, which he had displaced?</p><p>Cambridge began to sort slowly through the mind that was now almost completely his.  He used his own memories, his human memories, as calipers to measure the concepts and memories he found in this alien brain.  Things that did not match his human memories he set aside, trying to reconstruct what this Centaur Bug had been before it was invaded by him.  Slowly an ego picture of the Bug emerged.  It had been called Krikt (a clipped chirp impossible for a human voice to recreate.)  It was young, unmated, and male.  Looking forward to the mating chamber filled with fertile females.</p><p>A flickering shadow of epi-phenomenal essence snapped Cambridge’s mind away from his examination.  This shadow was something separate; not fully a part of the body Cambridge inhabited, and yet intimately connected with it.  Down the deepest corridors of memory and acculturation Haley began seeking the shadow.</p><p>A sense of horror was the first thing, which alerted Cambridge to the other anima.  It was filled with horror and fear, which emanated in thready, rapid waves like a staggering pulse.</p><p>“You don’t have to be afraid,” Cambridge sent the thought toward the cowering shadow.  It was like speaking, but somehow not.  “I’m sorry.  I won’t hurt you anymore.  I didn’t mean to integrate with you.”</p><p>The fear from the other lessened.</p><p>“I want to leave your body.  My own is waiting.”</p><p>“O demon,” Krikt answered.  “I know you not.  How can we speak? You are not like me.”</p><p>“In a sense I am you right now, and you are me.”</p><p>“But I cannot lift my hand.  My antenna are not my own.”</p><p>“That is because my anima, the part of me that makes me Haley Cambridge, is in control of your body now.”</p><p>“Can an orchard raider have such?  I have often chased ones like you back into the jungle.  I did not know you were part of the All Spirit.  I thought you only animals.”</p><p>“I am not an orchard raider.  I am from the stars.  Those from the jungle are like me in some ways, but they are not my people.”</p><p>A part of Cambridge noted that he had begun to communicate in rhythms like those of the Centaur bugs.  His human-ness was fading.</p><p>A low-pitched churring called Cambridge from the mental to the physical.  He opened his eyes.  There was no lack of control now.  He focused automatically.  Around him squatted eight females, all old and full of power.  They churred in unison and Cambridge knew it was a séance.  They were trying to exorcise whatever demon had invaded the body of their brother.</p><p>“You are right,” Krikt agreed.  “These speak with the Mother.  They call you forth that I may return.”</p><p>“Will they succeed?”</p><p>“I do not know.  Old ones speak of infesting and casting out, but they are old ones.  They see what others do not, especially just before they return to the All Spirit.”</p><p>“I hope it works.  I want to be released.”</p><p>“You did not come to devour me.” Krikt said, flatly.</p><p>“It was a mistake.  You pulled me in at the funeral pyre of the warriors.”</p><p>“We watched with the dead.  We almost go to the All Spirit then.  Our grief for the slain carries us.”</p><br><br><p>The séance chant went on for hours and became more irritating to Cambridge with each minute.  It was as though his psyche were being scoured with sandpaper.  “I am shaking loose,” he said at last, part joyful part terrified.  He did not know how long he had been imprisoned or if his body still lived.</p><p>“Soon you will fly to the other self,” Krikt said.  He was no longer a shadow.  He had become a glowing light, which shimmered with green fire.  He was no longer afraid.</p><p>“I am glad you no longer fear me.  I meant you no harm.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>The shrieking of the chant increased in power and Cambridge’s hold on the Centaur Bug released.  He was not completely free yet, but he no longer controlled.  Krikt was assuming control once again and the memories and thought that had been Cambridge’s suddenly became alien.</p><p>“Good bye Krikt.  I’m sorry.”</p><p>“I think I am not,” the other answered.  “We will meet again in the All Spirit, Cambridge.  Mother guide you until then.”</p><p>Cambridge was wrenched free!  Searing psychic pain took him for a moment, but it passed and he found himself adrift above the body he had just inhabited.  It lay on a raised stone couch in the center of an ovoid chamber.  The Mothers continued to shrill their exorcist chant but, as Cambridge watched, it cut off sharply.  In the silence the females nearest Krikt’s head clicked out a question.</p><p>Krikt answered and the circle of mothers rose and began a joyous singing that even lifted Cambridge’s spirits.  He watched a moment, then turned and moved through the dimness.</p><p>Outside the colony the sun blazed, turning the jungle screaming acid green in its brightness, but Cambridge was not assaulted by the color.  He saw everything through thickening twilight.  The anima light of his drug-induced seizure was gone.  Cambridge tried not to let the violet dimness worry him but dread and foreboding were like an itch deep in the bowels to which he was no longer connected.</p><p>Ship was still in place.  The hidden solar panel still drank in the sunlight and produced power, but inside Haley Cambridge found his body relaxed.  Ships life support was assisting it to live.  It was still strong and would remain so for a long time.  When it began to fail Ship would take up the slack.  Ship would continue to do some until its systems began to fail which was to say almost forever, and in all eternity Haley Cambridge could not return to the body because Ship could not re-induce the seizure that would open the psychic door to allow reintegration without specific command from the physical body sleeping peacefully on the couch.</p><br><br><p>        Time was impossible to judge.  Ship’s chronometer meant nothing to him.  There was no biological measure to give it meaning.  Cambridge had no heart beat to tick out the seconds; no bowel or bladder function to mark out the hours; no hunger or thirst to count off the days.  Time flowed together in an unending, indivisible stream.  Everything was constant dimness, unchanged by the darkness of death or the glow of life.  It was a half living, ghostly existence and it tempted him toward despair.</p><p>        There must be a way back!  He thought over and over.</p><p>        “There is no way,” came back the mocking echo from his mind, which increased his dread, but worse than the echo of dread he hated the euphoria.</p><p>        Euphoria came upon him in ever increasing waves as he tried to think of a way back.  Scintillating pleasure crept over him like loathsome, strangling moss blotting out thought.  He even found himself wishing for a return of pain or fear to stave it off.  If only he could thrust his hand into a fire for a moment to be relieved of the euphoria!</p><p>        Hands, he thought.  If I had hands I could pull the plugs and let myself die…or live.</p><p>        KRIKT.</p><p>        The thought had come to him before in moments of lucidity, but it did not connect to anything.  Hands?  Krikt?</p><p>And then Cambridge had it!  The idea was like firm ground in a swamp of ecstasy and Haley Cambridge clung to it as he hovered around the Centaur Bug colony.  He found Krikt almost immediately, though he did not know how he had recognized him, but when he tried to integrate with him he found it was not possible.  Cambridge felt he could touch the other’s anima, but integrating never came.  Still he dogged the Centaur Bug’s every move, attempting integration over and over.</p><p>Cambridge had almost given himself over to euphoria when he followed Krikt out for his turn at guarding the colony’s fields.  Krikt settled himself into his camouflaged position and began the preparation for long watching.  Cambridge knew the change instantly ad tried once again to integrate.</p><p>There was fear in the Centaur Bug.  Cambridge felt it more and more as the integration progressed, but it was not the blind terror like that which had blanked out the first integration.  Krikt seemed to know what was happening and, while there was apprehension, there was also willingness.</p><p>“You have returned.”</p><p>“I am sorry.  I did not wish it, but I could not return to my body.”</p><p>“Have you come to steal mine then?” Krikt was calm.</p><p>“No.  I have come to ask your help.”</p><p>“I have no power,” the Centaur Bug protested.  “I am male.  I have strength of arms and strength to care for the unborn, but I cannot speak with the Mother.  Why do you not fly to the Mother, that she may mix you with the All Spirit?”</p><p>“I cannot.  My body lives.”</p><p>Desperation fought with hope as Cambridge waited for Krikt to consider his plea.</p><p>At last Krikt answered, “I know not how to help you, but I will try.”</p><p>Relief bubbled in Cambridge as he explained what he wanted, but the relief drew back a little when the explanation came out as only a jumble to Krikt.  There were no parallel concepts to drug or computer.  Indeed even Cambridge’s concept of Ship translated only as a leaf upon which small creatures could float down a stream of water.</p><p>“I do not understand,” the Centaur Bug thought.</p><p>Cambridge considered a moment then thought, “I wish to use your hands to accomplish a task which will allow me to become one with my body again.”</p><p>“But I cannot leave my post.  The raiders might come and strip the fields and we will starve.”</p><p>Cambridge was loath to wait a second longer, but he knew with Krikt’s own memory that the Centaur Bugs lived very close to starvation always.  A raid from a rival colony or from the orchard raiding simians that stripped even one field might mean the difference between life and death for the colony.</p><p>“We will wait.”</p><br><br><p>        Krikt’s replacement came as the sun touched the treetops and when Krikt turned his post over to the other and started toward the jungle the other questioned him.</p><p>        “I seek signs of raiders,” Krikt answered and stumbled toward the blue-green depths of the jungle.</p><p>        At first the traveling was difficult.  The separate animas clashed in trying to control the one body, creating palsy.  Not until Cambridge withdrew completely from motor control did walking become normal.</p><p>        “Here,” Cambridge said.</p><p>        “I see nothing.”</p><p>        “Use your sword and cut away the growth, then dig down.  The door is there.”</p><p>        Krikt did it and after an hour he felt the first strike of his sword against the metal of the door.</p><p>        “Clear away the right side.  The latch is there.”</p><p>        Sometime later the door was clear and Cambridge said, “Now you must let me control your body.”</p><p>        Krikt relinquished control of his body to the alien in him.  He had not taken time before to be awed by what was before him, but as Cambridge scrapped away the last clods from the lock he thought, what power this demon holds!  The smiths of the people could not forge so much iron in a year as is in this door!</p><p>        “Not only the door,” Cambridge answered absently.  “The whole ship is metal, and it is thousands of times stronger than iron.”</p><p>        Cambridge used Krikt’s hands to open the panel over the hatch lock and silently breathed thanks to God that he had not had a personal identity lock put on it.  He punched in the combination code and saw the clear light wink on.</p><p>        The door sighed open and the two in one body stepped into the chamber.  They had to wait until the air lock cycled and the decontamination process was carried out.  The shape of the chamber disturbed Krikt.  It was cubical.  He had never seen anything square.  Chambers were round or ovoid.</p><p>        The inner door opened and they stepped into a larger square chamber.  In the center was a raised section covered with a glass sarcophagus with a body inside it.  Sight of the body shocked Krikt more than the square chambers.  It had too few limbs—only four—and its color was like a pupa.</p><p>        Cambridge checked the monitors and found that his body was still functioning mostly on its own.  He considered just shutting down the life support system and letting his body die.  It had been a long time since separation.  Returning to his body might mean death anyway, and not a peaceful one, but one filled with madness and agony, but it did not take Cambridge long to decide he would take the chance on life, and deal with the consequences later.</p><p>As Krikt watched detachedly Cambridge set up an abbreviated dose of the seizure drug.  Had he been in corpus he could have done the whole procedure by voice command, but now he had to work through the computer keyboard.  It was difficult.  Krikt’s hands were not those for which the keyboard was designed so Cambridge was forced to use only one finger.</p><p>The program set up, Cambridge considered again what would happen when he reintegrated with his body and decided to put a hedge program in to the computer. He added a sub-program.  If the body on the couch did not wake sufficiently in control of its faculties to cancel the sub-program within eight hours Ship would send a lethal dose of sleeping medication into it.  After a moment he reached toward the run key and said, “I am ready now.”</p><p>Krikt seized motor control, halting the hand in mid-reach.  “We have no Mothers!”</p><p>He thought frantically.  “We have no Mothers to cast you out!”</p><p>        “I know,” Cambridge soothed.  “We don’t need them, if you will watch with me as with the dead.”</p><p>“But you are not dead.  Your spirit lives.  Your body lives.  It is forbidden to watch with the living.  The Mother of All forbids it!  Only she creates and only she calls forth to the All Spirit.”</p><p>“But if you loosed the spirits of the others…the warriors—“</p><p>“They suffered!  That is why we killed them.  Their pain was our pain so we loosed them from it.  We could do nothing else.  And we did not watch with them while they lived.”</p><p>“I suffer Krikt!  Watch with me so it may end!”</p><p>The plea was a physical pain.</p><p>“What if I cannot release you even by watching?”</p><p>Cambridge could not answer, so he did not try; only waited.</p><p>Krikt considered.  What was asked of him was blasphemy.  And yet this creature was in pain.  More terrifying than death, this was un-death, and was it not more blasphemy than watching with Cambridge though he was not dead?</p><p>“I will watch with you.”</p><p>Cambridge thanked Krikt and took over motor control.  “When my body begins to change you will see it.  If I do not loosen and fly to it soon we must leave.  I have told Ship to kill my body if I have not returned to it and stopped the sequence within a day.</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>“Then let us begin.”  Cambridge pressed the run key on the computer and each being turned to his own anima, clearing thoughts and preparing.</p><p>Krikt began the thrum of watching with the dead.  He concentrated on freedom from pain—liberty from corporeal existence.  He willed the spirit, which was partly his own now, to fly to the Mother of All—to join the All Spirit.  At the same time he asked the father, to whom all males had recourse, to speak in Cambridge’s behalf.</p><p>Haley Cambridge turned inward.  The euphoria did not plague him now.  It had lessened with each moment he had been integrated with Krikt, but he sensed that it was waiting to pounce on him at the instant of release.  That did not trouble him.  He would deal with it when the need arose.</p><p>Ship’s chronometer ticked and the drug released into Cambridge’s waiting body’s veins.  Even in his anima form he felt the jolt of it like the blinding effect of switching on a too bright light in pitch darkness.  It was light, the anima light that would allow separation of spirit from body.</p><p>Krikt felt the jolt too.  He felt the loosening of the other anima the instant the drug began its work.  He continued the watching, willing Cambridge’s spirit free of his body.</p><p>The body on the couch reached the top of its classic grand mal arch, and the couch shaped itself to accommodate every movement of the body upon it.  Cambridge strained to be free of the integration with Krikt.  It was like pulling free from deep, sucking, mud, but he could feel himself loosening.</p><p>And he was free! Drifting outside both the flesh beings below him.</p><p>Euphoria exploded over him, drenching him with lethargic ecstasy and revulsion for imprisonment in flesh.  So much better to be free, it seemed to whisper to him.  You will be bound again. There will be pain again.  Better to remain un-flesh and unfettered.  It was seductive beyond comprehension.  To drift forever, bathed in pleasure.  Never to die or change…</p><p>“Never to live!”  Something cried.  Krikt, his anima crying out against the euphoria spoke.  “Do not listen to the evil! It will swallow you up and I will be cursed for helping you.  Return to yourself.  Life or death awaits you.  Better the one or the other than this.  Return!”</p><p>The euphoria was pushed back.  It's terrible smothering tentacles loosened under the combined will of Cambridge and Krikt, but it could not be held at bay for long.  Cambridge quickly entered his body and began the process of re-integration.</p><p>The body felt strange, alien and uncomfortable.  A prison.  But in moments it began to feel like a safe house to which Cambridge could become accustomed—if there was time; if he had not cut the dosage too short.</p><p>Cambridge noticed that the anima light was fading.  It guttered like an almost spent candle.  Soon the body would begin to release its epileptic strain.</p><p>Krikt saw the body settle when he returned from his meditative trance. He watched the tension go then he chirped, “I go now,” and turned toward the door.  Nothing happened.  Krikt had a shadow memory of the other doing something to open it, but he could not remember.</p><br><br><p>Cambridge heard a noise and opened his eyes.  Focusing was difficult and there was a churring sound that acted like a drilling pain through his eyeballs.  His anima still resisted complete integration with his body but, though his control was incomplete as yet, he could tell that the process would finish with him still in possession of his mind.  He turned his head slowly, seeking the source of the sound and when he saw the Centaur Bug, like a giant grasshopper with the chest and arms turned up like the man part of a centaur, he could make not connection of why the Centaur Bug was with him inside Ship’s cabin.  After a little the screeching chirp and the stimulants Ship was administering, penetrated the fog of incomplete integration.</p><p>“Why are you still here?” he asked, his voice a rusty groan.</p><p>The persistent churring stopped sharply and the multi facetted eyes turned to him.  Cambridge could not tell if there was understanding in them but he thought not.</p><p>Krikt chirped like a mammoth cricket and Cambridge knew the sounds of speech, but he could not understand what the other had said.</p><p>Exhaustion was heavy on Cambridge.  He wanted nothing but to sleep, but he could not let himself.</p><p>The Centaur Bug turned in the small space of the compartment and moved toward the door as Cambridge watched.  The door stayed closed.</p><p>“You can’t get out,” Cambridge said, discovery in his voice.  “You can’t work the door.”  In that instant he remembered the suicide sub-program and said, “Ship, abort sub-program. Repeat, Ship, abort sub-program.”</p><p>“Acknowledge,” answered the metallic voice of the ship.</p><p>Krikt started, glancing toward the source of the voice.  He began to back away toward the door in fear of the ghost who had spoken from a wall.  He stopped only because he was against the door.</p><p>“Ship, cycle air-lock,” Cambridge commanded, his voice stronger, then complied with the ships Tell me twice system by giving the command a second time.</p><p>“Acknowledged.”</p><p>The door sighed open and Krikt fell through.  He had been leaning against it too hard to stop himself.  It took a moment to untangle himself, then he stood and looked back at Cambridge.  He lifted his hand in farewell and Cambridge did the same as the door closed.</p><p>The cycle lights over the lock flickered through their sequence and when they finished Krikt went out.  He turned back for a moment as the door sighed closed behind him but did not stay.</p><p>Cambridge lay on the life support couch for a moment then said, “Ship, begin lift sequence.”  He repeated the command and added, “Let’s go home.”</p><p>“Acknowledged,” Ship answered and began.</p><br><br><p>THE END</p>
