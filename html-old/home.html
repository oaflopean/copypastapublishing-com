<p>Worms slithering through empty eye sockets, rib cage and other body cavities in search of nourishment. A once respectable suit gone to mildew, tatters and the inevitable disintegration that a lack of oxygen and light finally brings. Decomposing skin exposing bone in shredded, nightmarish patterns.</p><p>This is what you look like when you've been in the ground for a while. This is what you look like when you're dead.</p><p>This was the last thing the night guard at Our Lady of Final Rest saw as he crossed himself, muttered frightened expletives in Spanish and dropped dead of a heart attack. The last thing he saw. The last thing he saw was Hector Agular, or what was left of him, working his way out of the grave.</p><p>The last of his body wriggled up through the dirt. Instinctively he began to crawl; a snake like undulation not unlike his movements his first year out of the womb. He struggled to his feet; his near skeleton form wavering and then toppling on top of the guard's motionless form. Hector Agular felt the warmth as instinct, an urge acquired during four months in the ground and in the gateway to the beyond took over. He slowly, painfully opened his jaws and bit deep into the still warm flesh.</p><p>Hector stopped in mid bite, releasing the grip that had drawn and slow but steady rivulet of blood. He looked skyward. The gods had been kind to East Los Angeles this night. A full moon played amid a cloudless, late summer sky. The Hector dead thing once again struggled to its feet and, on more confident legs, moved his head around the unkempt lawns, bare trees and the array of tombstones, crosses and unmarked graves that marked the passage of life and death in this glorified potter's field.</p><p>Thoughts. No, more likely fragmentary impulses and the things we don't know about the body once the spirit of life leaves it, held Hector statue stiff. His initial urge had been to quell his physical hunger. But that had been overtaken by a more powerful desire. A goal that lay hundreds of miles to the South. A goal that had leaped out of the void and pulled him back from that final step into the big sleep.</p><p>Home.</p><p>Hector's body took one small shuffling step. Then another. And another. The journey of a whole lot of shuffling steps had begun. The body moved slowly out of the cemetery and into the heart of the barrio. Home, and what it meant, played out in an endless, deadened loop inside the exposed skull where a brain no longer existed and a stone dead body was hanging on for dear life.</p><p>\"Hector!\" cried his mother from inside a jumble of sheet metal and aluminum siding that was the home of Francisco and Carlita Agular and their six children. Outside, on the dirty, dusty, feces encrusted streets that were the home of Tijuana's poor, seven year old Hector Agular indulged himself in his favorite pasttime, pounding a fire ant hill with a twig. There was no malice in his eyes as he destroyed the industrious ant's good work. Nor anything else approaching an emotion.</p><p>Hector was, as the doctors in the charity clinic had so indelicately put it, 'not right in the head'. The boy got up at his mother's call and, looking at the setting sun, put two and two together and came up with supper.</p><p>Inside he joined his parents and his five brothers and sisters in a circle around a fire and a cook pot. Small plates, piled high with a beans and rice mixture, were passed around and the ritual of silent consumption began. Silent on the outside but, for Hector, it was a time to give thanks. It was the one meal of the day he could count on and the fact that it was not healthy did not stop it from being warm and comforting in the pit of his stomach. Hector smiled a child-like, not all there smile. He was oblivious to this hell on earth.</p><p>For him it was simply home.</p><p>The one and only time Hector met organized religion was during a hastily conceived ceremony with a neighborhood priest that legitimized Hector's first sexual encounter, at age 14, with 13 year old Rosa Torres that resulted in the first of four children in as many years. Hector and Rosa's parents sighed at the futility of it all; knowing full well that at the end of the tunnel that was hopelessness, the babies just come with the scenery. For Hector and Rosa, who were light years away from knowing how babies were made, the act was something that felt good and the result was \"gee the ninos are so cute.\"</p><p>Hector and his wife moved into a ramshackle hut of their own and, while Rosa worked hard at making something out of nothing, Hector joined the legions of uneducated young men in long periods of unemployment, sporadic periods of low pay stoop labor and the raids on garbage heaps and market dumpsters for the necessities that insured the cycle of poverty would continue.</p><p>Rosa would often despair at their lot in life and nag Hector to do better. Hector would smile, draw terminally inward on his own fantasy world and wait, patiently, for the better world he was sure would come.</p><p>Hector's carcass hugged the dark as he shambled that dead two step through a deserted section of South Central Los Angeles. The area had been his turf for the five human days that he was once again walking the earth.</p><p>\" Hey man!,\" growled a slurring, drunk voice from somewhere in the blackness. \"Where the fuck do you think you're going?\"</p><p>Hector stopped and cocked his head down where the image of something smelly, tattered and, except for the fact that it was alive, something just as much a zombie as he was. The sound of scuffling and muttering signaled this 'corpse' getting to its feet.</p><p>\"I said, where do you think, um. . .\"</p><p>The wino stopped cold. The sound of glass shattering against the street signaled the death of a pint of Old Battery Acid. The derelict had looked into Hector's sunken, empty shell of a face and had seen his future.</p><p>The sound of police chopper blades whipped the air. A siren wailed in the distance. The sun was beginning to rise. Hector sought out the nearest dumpster, climbed in and burrowed under a mound of maggot infested garbage. He did not fear the sunlight. But something deep down inside, where his heart used to be, told him that the sun would only get in the way of his getting home.</p><p>Hector heard the tales when the men gathered on street corners. Across the border in the United States of America. Where you can earn $3 an hour and the work's pretty regular and the roof does not leak. The mystery and hope surrounding what lay beyond the inspection point and the line of cars snaking in and out of his land fit ideally with Hector's simple minded view of the world.</p><p>It did not, however, fit into Rosa's scheme of things. Pregnant with their fifth child and beaten senseless by life, she saw only foolishness in Hector's tales of the good life in the United States Of America. But Hector was obsessed with making a new life in the land beyond the lights.</p><p>So obsessed that talk quickly turned to plan and plan flowered just as quickly into action. His first feeble attempt, bribing a tourist to smuggle him out in the trunk of his car, was easily quashed by border guards who flushed him during a routine inspection. A week later he attempted a midnight scamper across a vast expanse of canyon that separates Mexico and the United States. Halfway across he was beaten and robbed by banditos and left sprawled on a rise to be plucked by a passing INS patrol.</p><p>Hector persisted and the third time's the charm.</p><p>Hector half dragged/half stumbled along a sandy shore line somewhere between San Pedro and Huntington Beach. The tide, illuminated by full on moonlight, reflected garish fluorescence as it lapped at the foot drag marks he left behind. A lone gull, sensing food in Hector's shell, dived and ripped a small shard of skin from his body and then torpedoed back into the sky. Hector sensed the intrusion but passed it from his decaying life tape. He was already dead.</p><p>When he reached home, he would also be at rest.</p><p>The Coyote had dropped them on the beach. It had been dark. The coastline shot up high and steep. The future unsure. But while others who had accompanied him on this underground railway to the United States voiced their fear as they shivered in the ocean breezes, Hector raved as only a madman could that they would certainly prosper in the United States of America.</p><p>Hector was an able student in the education that was street. He began at the bottom; sharing a hobo camp under the freeway, scrounging aluminum cans and scrap metal for a few cents for a fast food burger and fries that would see him through another day. He moved up a rung to a church run soup kitchen for food and a bed at night. A few words of English snuck into his vocabulary. Hector's diploma was the day he discovered a day labor street corner on Fifth St. and Boyle.</p><p>Hector's halting English, as well as his willingness to work long hours at much less than minimum wage, made him a favorite with the vultures who paid daily visits to Fifth and Boyle for cheap, illegal labor. Occasionally he would be ripped off but Hector was lucky enough, often enough, to be able to leave the church after a month for a small firetrap of a room in a slum cell owned by an uptown gringo.</p><p>He would forego the games of chance, drinking and the loose women who were his country men's only diversions and, weekly, make the 10 block trek to the Western Union to send money home to Rosa. Wrapped around the money order would be the note: I am fine. I work real hard. I will send for you and the ninos soon. Hector.</p><p>Soon never arrived.</p><p>The firetrap became just that one Friday night when a blaze of suspicious origin toasted the building and 14 of its occupants. Hector had not died well; his last breath a choking mixture of smoke and hot cinders. But there was a recognizable body to lug down to the morgue, tag and finally to bury, minus a tombstone, in the ground of Our Lady of Final Rest. Hector Agular lay in a cheap, pine box.</p><p>He was not completely dead.</p><p>Physically he was nearly dust, a mindless vessel awaiting the endless onslaught of the elements. But somewhere between the invisible elements that had once housed cerebellum and cerebral cortex, a slim thread of desire was hanging on; refusing to join the rest of Hector at the pearly gates. And rather than sparking harmlessly, the desire of Hector to go home, to find solace in the soil of his birth grew in strength even as his body went the way of all physical flesh.</p><p>Home, home, home, wailed the living leftover inside the husk. I want to go home.</p><p>Four months later, an arm reached out of its resting place, slammed against the inside of the coffin lid and fell weakly to its side. A moment later the other arm repeated the process. Nothing. Not even a dent. The first arm shot out again. Then the other. Then the other. Two weeks later, the lid of the pine box split, sending a cascade of fine dirt into the coffin.</p><p>Home, home, home said the body. It started to dig.</p><p>Hector passed silently through the ravines and canyons. Above him, car headlights slid by; forming darts of light and shadow as the cars rolled the last 500 yards to the California-Mexico border. Hector's body stood in the mud below, allowing the air of the United States of America to wash over him one last time. He turned and began his death march through a twisting-turning canyon path. Off in the distance the outline of low slung adobe and shanty architecture blinked in and out of low, lazy light.</p><p>Home was only a few hundred yards away.</p><p>\"Stop!\"</p><p>Angry Mexicans leaped out of the darkness ahead of Hector. He continued on. \"I said stop, you stupid peon or I'll blow your fucking brains out!\"</p><p>Hector had heard the words in his other life. Ravine banditos. He did not miss a step. A trio of angry young punks, full of drink and armed with primitive automatic weapons, stepped in Hector's path. Young, dirty pond scum praying on people on the road to a better life.</p><p>\"My God!,\" moaned one of the toughs as Hector came into view. He crossed himself and followed the remainder of the rat pack as they scrambled off the road and onto higher ground. Hector paid them no mind as he walked by. If he had eyes in the back of his head or, for that matter, eyes period, he would have seen the coward's courage return as they trained their weapons at his back.</p><p>A shot rang out, the bullet slicing through Hector's back and out his chest. Another round in the same place shattered a rib tip and sent the piece falling to rest on the brittle, cracking skin of his stomach cavity.</p><p>\"Hey motherfucker!,\" yelled one of the bandits. \"You maybe dead, but now you're going to be really dead.\"</p><p>The boast was followed by a burst of automatic weapons fire that tore through Hector's lower body, severing his right leg below the knee. Hector fell in a heap, struggled to a standing position on his one good leg and hopped on.</p><p>Home, home, home said his mind shred in a mental monotone, suddenly shot through with urgency. Home, home.</p><p>\"That's it motherfucker! Hop! Hop 'til you drop!\"</p><p>Another blast riddled his chest, turning his insides to splinters and dust. Yet another cut his right arm off at the elbow.</p><p>Hector hopped around a mound of dirt and rock and up a slight incline. What was left of his body lost its balance and toppled to the earth. The bandits whooped and hollered as they leaped upon his remains. Hector was wriggling like a worm as he tried to get up as the bandits stood over the writhing corpse. \"Die motherfucker!,\" they roared in unison.</p><p>A final salvo severed his skull from the rest of his body. A skull that lay helpless while the rest of his body turned to dust under a final hail of lead. The gunfire stopped. The bandits yelled obscene victory and passed around a bottle of cheap wine as they stomped among Hector's remains, grinding the surviving bone and skin fragments under their boots. One of the hoods spotted Hector's skull partially buried in the mud. He reached down and picked it up; holding the skull within inches of his drunken, smirking face.</p><p>He stared into the eye sockets, eyed the slack jaw, contemplating its fate. He put it down in the dirt and aimed his pistol at a spot guaranteed to reduce it to atoms. His finger tightened on the trigger.</p><p>And loosened.</p><p>He picked up the skull, looked around in all directions and, with a high pitched animal scream, ran up a short stretch of incline and heaved the skull.</p><p>The skull of Hector Agular flew through space, tumbling in a tight circle. It hit the ground with a thud, the impact tearing its jaw away. The skull of Hector Agular came to rest on a mound of sand.</p><p>The mind blip, flickering in final confused torment, looked out through empty orbs. It came upon a tumbled down hovel made of aluminum siding and cardboard. Candlelight flickered inside. A cacophony of Mexican pierced the still night sky. A small child wandered out of the shanty and urinated into the dry, dusty road. The stream flowed down a depression, sending a colony of fire ants scurrying for cover.</p><p>Hector Agular's mind tape gave him his final sleep.</p><p>\"Home,\" said Hector as he slipped to the other side.</p><p>\"I am home.\"</p>
