<p>Joe looked at himself in the full length mirror. As usual there was nothing to complain about.</p><p>He still had all his hair and all his teeth. He was built, all pecs, abs and glutes. He was hung like a horse and he could go all night. He was beating them off with a stick. There was only one problem.</p><p>Joe shot blanks. His sperm were DOA. Always had been, always would be. If anybody found that out, he would be dead meat. But so far so good.</p><p>In the old days, there was always action. Girls were literally beating down the door to have a little Joe. Joe always went bareback. And the women were always disappointed when they did not wind up with a bun in the oven. But still they came sniffing around; sure that they would be the one to strike pay dirt. All was fine in Joe's world, until the world came to an end.</p><p>All the religious fanatics eventually got it right. It wasn't God's revenge on sinners in 2012 but, rather, a swarm of runaway asteroids a few years down the road. It was like every bad sci fi movie. A few people decided to play God and a list of all the necessary people to get earth up and pumping after the apocalypse was drawn up.</p><p>Scientists, farmers, carpenters, doctors. Those young enough to grow old. And then there were people like Joe. No discernible skills but all horn dog and testosterone and, they thought, ready, willing and able to help repopulate the planet once the floods receded and the magma cooled.</p><p>Fortunately for Joe they weren't checking paperwork in those last frantic days before those chosen to live hunkered down in the shelters. They simply asked and Joe simply performed on a couple of willing women and that was it.</p><p>So the end came and went and the survivors slowly emerged from their holes and began to build again. Joe was lucky at first. The women made regular rounds of all the available men so nobody was ever quite sure who impregnated who. That a couple of those early babies kinda/sorta resemble Joe, and he was quick to take the credit, got him through the first few years.</p><p>But once the honchos at the top got a little master race in them, things began to get a bit dicey. Joe was presented with a select and limited list of shapes and sizes; ideal for building the perfect beast. Joe could pop a chubby all night long but people began to get suspicious when he was not popping out babies.</p><p>The end of the world did not affect women's cycles so he could always use that as an excuse. He was quick to float the age question and, sadly, one of his better concubines suddenly disappeared. He had hoped she would be shipped off to somebody more potent, rather than the punch line he thought. What do you do with somebody who can't produce? You kill them and eat them. Ha ha ha. That's a good one.</p><p>Joe was quick to join in the laughter around the community dining tables. But he knew he was on borrowed time.</p><p>And that point was being driven home tonight. Because Marilyn was going to be making a call.</p><p>Marilyn was a legend in these parts. Rumored to be barely legal when the end came, she was now closing in on 35. If you believed the gossip mill, Marilyn and any number of sperm donors were responsible for at least 25 offspring. She was considered top of the line and, of late, had become a specialist in those hard to conceive cases. If you couldn't knock up Marilyn, you were either sterile or gay.</p><p>The door to Joe's cubicle swung open and there stood Marilyn. Naked as a jaybird, all her parts were in the right place and wrapped up in an enticing bow of blonde going slightly gray hair. Nice face but showing a little ragged around the edges. Popping out babies for the greater good was not an easy job. She moved matter-of- factly into the room and sat on the bed. She eyed his nakedness up and down, almost bored with it all, as she came to his full blown erection.</p><p>\"Well at least you're not gay,\" she sighed.</p><p>\"Back at ya,\" chuckled Joe, watching as his attempt at humor fell completely flat before her icy stare.</p><p>Marilyn got right down to business. Reciting the particulars like a cop used to read a drunk his rights. \"We have sex on a daily basis until I get pregnant. Then we go our separate ways. I give birth. The kid goes to The Hierarchy, and-\"</p><p>\"And we go onto the next?,\" slyly interjected Joe.</p><p>\"At least I do,\" she countered with no small bit of accusation in her voice.</p><p>Joe's hipper than thou smile twitched noticeably. That verbal uppercut to his ego hit a little too close to home. \"You know something I don't?\"</p><p>\"Look Joe, you seem like a decent enough guy and I'm sure the sex will be just fine. But I'm not here because I absolutely have to have your penis. The Hierarchy sent me because they have their suspicions. And I'm the litmus test. If I can't get pregnant then there's definitely something wrong with you.\"</p><p>Joe's mind raced like a runaway train. He had been playing out this particular rope for years. Now they were catching wise and were closing in. He really didn't care that he had, seemingly, come to the end of the line. They used to say that confession was good for the soul. So here goes.</p><p>\"Why don't we save all the wear and tear. I can't get you pregnant. There isn't a child walking around what's left of this planet that's mine. Now what are you going to do about it?\"</p><p>Joe's candor and outright pissedness caught Marilyn off guard. She had never had to deal with this situation before. It had always been in and out, strictly business. Emotion, even bad emotion, had never entered the picture. All she could do was look at Joe for what seemed like forever.</p><p>Finally she broke the silence. â€œYou know what The Hierarchy will do if they find out?\"</p><p>\"No! Why don't you, the big bad baby machine, tell me.\"</p><p>Marilyn could not help but smile at the sarcasm. She did have that reputation. And it did make for a somewhat easier life than others had in this post end of the world existence.</p><p>\"Well for openers, don't believe those stories about being turned into hamburger for the masses. The Hierarchy are ruthless but not savages, at least not yet. But what they will do is castrate you and give you a one-way ticket to the Chaos Zone where you'll dig ditches and do all manner of shit jobs until you drop dead.\"</p><p>Joe's hands had instinctively gone to his privates. By comparison being killed and eaten didn't sound too bad. It was then that he felt his bulge return; impervious to all the threats possible in the future and downright horny for the woman who might rat him out.</p><p>\"And what about you,\" Joe said as cool as any man could be with a full blown erection. \"It would be a crime against nature to do to you what they would do to me.\"</p><p>Marilyn smiled a smile dripping with irony. \"I've got a few more good birthing years left in me. Then I'll be sent off to do the bidding of a higher up in The Hierarchy. It will be lousy sex and no sex before I'm shuttled off to The Red Room to educate the next crop of concubines. Then I'll grow old, eat fattening food and die.\"</p><p>Joe sighed at the futility of it all. He didn't care anymore and it was certain that Marilyn was light years beyond jaded. What to do? What to do?</p><p>\"You know,\" said Joe in a tone that was so matter of fact it was scary. \"We could just play along with The Hierarchy's grand plan. Be together for as long as we can fake it and then. . . I don't know. . . just die or disappear into some as yet uncharted regions. I was a boy scout in my previous life and I was considered a prize when it came to building a Teepee. I'm sure if we played our cards right, it would buy us a year.\"</p><p>Marilyn looked at Joe like he was a one celled something from another time and place. He was obviously out of his mind. But it couldn't hurt to play along.</p><p>\"So you get off on a regular basis and I don't get knocked up. What's in it for me?\"</p><p>Joe smiled and walked up behind her. He began to gently massage her shoulders. The tension began to melt away. There was a low moan of pleasure that was almost as good a feeling as the orgasms she had long ago forgotten she had ever had. Marilyn thought this was a good opening gambit. Joe continued to kneed her flesh.</p><p>\"You'll find that I'm actually a pretty good lover rather than a 'wham, bam thank you m'am ' kind of guy. I'll open doors for you. I'll even bring you flowers if I can find any.\"</p><p>Marilyn laughed. Then she cried. If the world had not come to an end and she had not become a vessel to help repopulate the planet, this was the kind of bullshit she would have heard from guys on dates who were only trying to get into her pants. Finally, the crying stopped.</p><p>She turned to Joe and planted a soft, loving kiss on his lips. He returned the same. They smiled like two young lovers on the verge. There was lust and it showed. But there was also a faint beating of hearts.</p><p>\"Why don't we just go to bed and sleep on it,\" stammered Marilyn, trying hard not to break out in little girl laughter. The pair awkwardly tumbled into the bed. Joe was immediately on her but in a tender way. Pecks on her lips and neck. Tongue attention on her breasts and then lower that sent electric charges through her body. Marilyn and Joe smiled and laughed easily as, for the first time since the world died and was reborn. They made love.</p>
