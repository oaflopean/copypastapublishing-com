<p>That's when the cavalry stepped in. Sullen biker chick tossed a very dirty looking towel in his face. Two other leatheroids stepped in and began wailing on the crowd. Eddie staggered off the stage and passed the members of Wrecking Crew waiting by the exit. They offered compliments, saying that was the best gimmick they had seen since the 1993 Kiss tour.</p><p>Eddie said nothing but continued his stumble out the back exit, towel pressed hard against his forehead, attempting to staunch the blood flow. He found a trash can, turned it over and sat in silence as the aroma of beer, sweat and urine washed over him. Eddie sat in silence for what seemed like a half hour.</p><p>Finally, the blood stopped. He would need stitches but he would live.</p><p>But that throbbing at the back of his head. It was deadly, consistent, and, if he could get around the pain, it was a pretty good beat. Eddie laughed at the futility of it all. Once he stopped laughing, his head slowly began to bob and weave in time to the imagined rhythm. There was something in this. The more he thought about it, the more it felt like something.</p><p>It felt like rock and roll.</p><p>Eddie reached into his back pocket and pulled out the envelope containing the cash. Another pocket dive produced a piece of crap Bic pen. He stared at the envelope for a moment, put pen to paper and, shakily, started to write. After a moment he stopped, looked at what he had written, crossed out the part he didn't like and wrote some more.</p><p>Everything hurt like a motherfucker but Eddie managed a wane smile. This was pretty good. Eddie continued to write on his perch behind the bar. When he ran out of envelope, he fished a ratty, beer soaked paper bag out of a nearby box and began to write on that.</p><p>Eddie Hodge had crossed over into the possibility of being a two hit wonder. And it felt good.</p>
