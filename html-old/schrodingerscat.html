<p> I’ve been in a lot of strange places with my buddy Big Dave, some of which scared the bejesus out of me, but being in the basement of  Chin’s Golden Palace in China town was spooky in a different kind of way. I was afraid we were gonna get arrested seeing as how this was an illegal gambling establishment, but, as per usual Dave said he wanted to go check the place out because he might want to use the setting in a screen play he was putting together. Now Dave is not usually a screen writer, he’s a poet who writes greeting cards, but he knows about screen writing because he often works as an extra in movies and TV. He is 6’6” tall and about 250 lbs with long hair and beard and he rides a chopped motorcycle so he looks the part of a crazy ass Hells Angel or a wild eyed serial killer and gets a good deal of work because of it. He also works as a location scout for some of the pick-up production companies around Hollywood.</p><p>        Now, the basement of Chin’s Golden Palace was set up as a bar/casino with Mah Jong and Chinese Keno set up right beside Black Jack, Baccarat, crap tables and roulette wheels. The place was crowded and noisy with a pall of smoke hanging up around the ceiling. Smoking is illegal in most eating and drinking establishments in California but I guess Chin figured that he was already breaking the law with his casino so what was a little smoking misdemeanor.</p><p>        Dave and I sat at a tall table near the bar sipping Tsing Tao beer and watching the action. “Can we get out of here yet, Dave” I asked. “It’s boring watching these guys, and Michele said she wouldn’t go my bail the next time LA Law enforcement took exception to what I was doing.” Michele is my loving wife and meal ticket of forty plus years who used to be a Master Sergeant in the Air Force.</p><p>        “Aw, relax G. Chin’s probably paid off everybody from Garcetti on down. This joint ain’t gonna get raided.”</p><p>        “Sez you.”</p><p>        “Yeah, sez me. Drink your beer.”</p><p>        I took another sip and resigned myself to sitting quietly and praying, Lord I hope he’s right.</p><p>        “Watch that guy right there G,“ Dave said and lifted his beard in the direction of the crap table nearest us.</p><p>        I looked over and there was a Chinese—or I guess Chinese, I can’t tell Chinese from Japanese from Korean—but he was rather larger than most of the people standing around him at the table. He was dressed in jeans and a black Tee shirt with a cartoon cat on it. Below the cat was the word “Schrödinger’s.” It had an address under it.</p><p>“Schrödinger’s Cat.” I laughed.  “He doesn’t look much like a Schrödinger. Wong maybe. What’s up with him?” I said  “He isn’t even the shooter.”</p><p>        “He rakes in every time the dice roll. He bets the number sometimes, he bets the don’t come sometimes, he never bets the field and he has bet the hard way a lot. Even bet the box cars a couple times and won every time.”</p><p>        “Just lucky. I mean I’ve done that a couple of times in Vegas. I made seven straight passes once.”</p><p>        “Really?”</p><p>        “Yeah and like a complete Jack ass I didn’t pick up my chips and go home. Stood there and lost damn near all of it till I came to my senses. I still ended up with a couple hundred.”</p><p>        “He just won again,” Dave said.  “It’s like he knows what is gonna happen.”</p><p>        At last the dice passed to the guy. He had a damned fine stack of chips in the chip slots on  the table rails, and he had been betting pretty liberally, but when the dice came to him he pulled a ten dollar chip out of the pile, put it on the come line and threw the dice.  A natural Seven. The croupier paid him but he didn’t pick it up just let it ride. Let ‘em roll. Another natural seven.  Again he didn’t pick up the chips off the line. Let ‘em roll a third time. Hard eight. A pair of fours.  Three more non-winning rolls then a five and three. Not a hard eight but he hadn’t bet on the hard way and eight still wins.  He had been making hard way bets a lot before and winning, but this time he hadn’t.  Now he had a pretty good stack of chips on the line. I would have probably picked up most of it and put it with the rest of my winnings but he didn’t. He had about a hundred and sixty bucks on the line but he just let ‘em ride. He rattled the dice and let ‘em roll. Snake eyes, and the hundred and sixty bucks was gone.</p><p>        “I knew his streak couldn’t last forever,” I said. And apparently he knew it too because he pulled out the tail of his tee shirt and began scooping his chips from the rail into the shirt. I couldn’t count it  of course but I could see several hundred dollar chips and maybe even a couple of five hundreds in there. It had to be a couple thousand any way. He got his chips all corralled in his shirt then dipped into the pile, pulled out hundred dollar chip and flipped it to the dealer then another and flipped it to the stick man.</p><p>        “Damn! Two hundred bucks in tips? Wow”</p><p>        A cute Chinese waitress in a tutu came up about then. “He’s always a good tipper,” she said. “You guys want another Tsing Tao?”</p><p>        “He in here a lot?” Dave asked.</p><p>        “No. Once in a while. You want another beer or not?”</p><p>        “Yeah, I guess,” I said and watched as her tutu swayed toward the bar.</p><p>        “You know, there’s a bar up in Pasadena near Cal Tech called Schrödinger’s Cat.” Dave said.</p><p>        “Really?”</p><p>        “Yeah. I been by there, but I never been in.”</p><p>        “I liked his Tee shirt.”</p><p>        “Yeah, me too. Maybe we should go up there and see if we can get some Tee shirts.”</p><p>        “OK.”</p><br><br><p>Couple of weeks later Dave and I finally got over to Pasadena and found Schrödinger’s.  We went in and were surprised as hell to find the dice table genius behind the bar, still wearing his black Schrödinger’s Tee shirt. Place was pretty empty so we sat at the bar and ordered a couple of Tsing Tao’s.</p><p>“I don’t keep Tsing Tao,” he said.</p><p>“OK, what do you got on tap?” I asked.</p><p>He ran through the usual national brands (which I personally think tastes like horse pee) then got to some good craft beers. “Gimme a Fat Tire,” Dave said.</p><p>“Yeah, make it two.”</p><p>He drew the beers set ‘em down in front of us and said, “You really drink Tsing Tao? That isn’t what Gai Jin usually drink.”</p><p>“Usually I drink it with my Chop Suey.”</p><p>“Ah,” he said completely unsurprised.</p><p>The joint wasn’t our usual style, and it was kinda far away from the Desert too unless you ride over Angeles Crest, but it was a pretty comfortable place and  we started going over there once in a while. I liked it because of the name and the old quantum mechanics thing about Schrödinger’s cat and how it could be both dead and alive inside the sealed box and sure enough Irving Schrödinger—who was the bar tender and looked not at all like an Irving or a Schrödinger, but more like a Chu or a Wong or Chin—but, though  he called himself Schrödinger and he had a cat that hung around the bar. Beautiful Cat. Blue-Gray Persian that was friendly to everybody, but not really friendly to anybody in that feline way.</p><p>        Dave and I were sitting in the bar one Tuesday evening just kinda half listening to the news on TV when the cat seemed to just sorta appear at our table. I mean, it was just like he had vaporized out of the air and parked himself by Dave.</p><p>        It is kinda hard to picture Dave as a cat person. I mean he’s 6’6”  250lbs and all of it looks mean, but he is probably one of the gentlest men I have ever known but don’t misunderstand me. Big Dave could be a real handful if he got exercised, but it usually took quite a lot to get him upset about anything.  That night when the cat appeared on our table Dave just reached out his big paw and softly stroked the cats back. The cat didn’t mind and in fact sorta leaned into Dave’s hand as though asking him to do it some more.</p><p>        “Nice cat Irv,” Dave said stroking the length of the cat again. “What’s his name?”</p><p>        “He’s a She,” Irving said from behind the bar. “Her name’s Fam, which is short for Familiar.”</p><p>        “You a wizard, Irv?” I asked.  “Keeping a familiar?”</p><p>        Schrödinger laughed, but didn’t answer.</p><p>        “You know what G,” Dave asked.  “I think cats are interdimensional.”</p><p>        I looked at him over the top of my glasses and waited for him to go on. A lot of our conversations have started this way in the past.  “Interdimensional?” I asked.</p><p>        “Yeah. You know, string theory and mulit-dimension space and like that.”</p><p>        “Yeah, I know what interdimensional means, but I don’t know about cats.”</p><p>        “Did you see how Puss—“ Dave began</p><p>             “Her name’s Fam,” Irving said</p><p>“Did you see how Fam here just sorta appeared?”</p><p>        “Yeah. Cats do it all the time. They go and come as they damn please.”</p><p>        “Right. And sometimes they just decide they don’t want to be seen and wink out over into some other dimension. That’s why they are said to have nine lives.”</p><p>        “Well, that would certainly throw a monkey wrench into Schrödinger’s cat in the box theory. Would the cat be just dead or dead in all nine lives or what?”</p><p>        “They really can just sorta walk through walls ya know,” Irving said from behind the bar.</p><p>“People can too.”</p><p>        “What are you drinking back there Irv? People walking through walls...” Dave said, but I knew he was not quite as sure as he sounded. We had seen some pretty strange things in our adventures so neither of us were ready to just dismiss what seemed impossible</p><p>        Irving continued. “The stories go that there are certain monks who have studied reality in such a way so as to understand that solid mass is not really solid.”   He picked up a glass from the stack behind the bar and lobbed it over to me. I caught it.</p><p>        “Feels solid enough to me...” I said pitching it back to him,”...except for that big empty bubble in the middle where Maker’s Mark is supposed to be.”</p><p>        Dave laughed and added, “Me too.”</p><p>        Schrödinger pulled the square bottle up and poured shots for both, then one for himself.  He brought them over and, since it was a Tuesday evening and not much happening in the joint, sat down.</p><p>        “That’s quantum mechanics,” Dave said.</p><p>        “Yeah. And the old stuff about monks walking through walls and flying and all that is quantum mechanics too” Irv  said. “They just learned how to use it.”</p><p>We all sipped bourbon and thought about that for a while.  “Well, I have heard it said that  making things happen is really only a matter of wanting them to happen bad enough. Miracles and like that.  Finding a dime in the street just when you need a dime.”</p><p>              “Naw,” Dave said. “That is luck, not quantum mechanics.”</p><p>        “Maybe luck is quantum mechanics?” I said.</p><p>        “Maybe and maybe not,”  Irving said. “But we’re talking about willful use of quantum mechanics to do something that seems impossible.”</p><p>        “Or maybe magic,” Dave said.</p><p>        That rather got all of our attention.  Dave looked us both over and grinned. “Maybe magic, I mean real magic, not sleight of hand or misdirection or anything like that, but real magic, is just the manipulation of quantum reality. I mean, your monks walking through walls or flying or raising the dead or whatever, that would qualify as magic wouldn’t it? Or how about a fella knowing what number is gonna come up on rolled dice?”</p><p>        Irving looked at Dave with narrowed eyes, but let it pass with a  shrug. “Lots of SF writers have said that any sufficiently advanced technology could be classified as magic by primitive people.”</p><p>        We thought about that for a time.  “If it was real,” I said. “But as of now quantum manipulation or magic or whatever ya wanna call it is just speculation.  Makes a good story but that’s about all.”</p><p>        “Weeeellll,” Irving said, drawing the word out.  “I’ve seen some pretty strange stuff.”</p><p>        “Yeah, me too,” I said remembering Big Dave hauling me out of the clutches of the ghost of Tiburcio Vasquez by my collar and the seat of my britches.</p><p>        “And just where have you seen this strange stuff, Schrödinger?”  Dave asked.</p><p>        “China Town.  There’s an old wizard over there...,”</p><p>        “He got some of those little furry guys that you ain’t supposed to get wet?” Dave chuckled.</p><p>        “Ha, Ha,” Irving responded.</p><p>        “Is he one of your Magic Monks?” I asked.</p><p>        “Not exactly. ” Irving said but didn’t go any further.</p><p>        After a little Dave grunted then yawned. “I gotta be on set over by Lake LA tomorrow at 0500 so I’m outa here.”</p><p>“Another Crazy Ass Biker, or what?” I asked. Dave  nodded. He had yet to have any lines, but any movie that required a big, mean looking, Mofo seemed to want him.</p><p>        “Yeah I guess I better get on too.” I said. “Wouldn’t do to antagonize the wife. Might need her to go my bail again someday.  What do we owe ya?”</p><p>        Irving got this squenched look on his face and said—“I’ll roll ya for it.”</p><p>        “Roll us?” Dave asked.</p><p>        “Sure. Poker Dice.  You roll, then I roll. Whoever is the highest wins. You win, the drinks are on the house. I win the drinks cost double.”</p><p>        From somewhere a leather cup appeared on the table. Irving picked it up and shook it so the dice rattled inside.</p><p>        I thought about it for a minute then said, “Ah, what the hell. I could use a free drink.” Dave didn’t look so convinced.</p><p>        Irving rattled the dice in the cup once more and plunked it in front of me.  “Roll ‘em,” he said.</p><p>        I put my hand over the top of the cup, picked it up and rattled it then dumped the dice out. The five cubes did a little gallop across the table top and stopped at a three a four an ace and two fives.</p><p>        “Not bad, G,” Dave said. “Pair of fives.”</p><p>        Schrödinger raked the dice back into the cup, shook ‘em and let ‘em roll. Again the little gallop and bang, three sixes and two fives. Full house.</p><p>        “Ouch!,” I said, and started reaching for my wallet.</p><p>        Irving grinned and waved a finger at me. “Keep your money, “ he said.  “I cheated.”</p><p>        “Ah ha,” Dave said. “What do you got, loaded dice?”</p><p>        “No, no,” he said grinning wider.</p><p>        “Yeah if they were loaded they should have worked for me too, so how’d ya do it? Palm the dice I rolled with and substitute the others?”</p><p>        Schrödinger shook his head still grinning.  “Quantum Mechanics,” he said and turned back to the bar.</p><p>        “Hey,” I protested. “You can’t just drop a bomb like that and walk off.”</p><p>        He reached over the bar and came up with the bottle of Makers Mark which he brought back to the table, and from which he poured us each another shot.</p><p>        “The scientists,” he began, “ have been talking about quantum Mechanics and ‘dark energy’ and ‘dark matter.’  Well they are all way late to the party. Chinese philosophers and scientists—some people call them wizards— have been using ‘dark energy’ for a thousand years. Western science is just catching up. Just like the Chinese and Japanese and Korean’s have been using acupuncture for a thousand years, but Western Science just caught onto the fact that it works in the last twenty years or so.” He took a sip of the red gold whiskey in his glass.</p><p>        “And you are one of those ancient Chinese philosophers that can use this ‘dark energy’? Dave said skeptically.</p><p>        Irving looked across the top of his glass and shrugged. “Not ancient, but I have been studying I Ch’ing since I was a kid.  Hell, I spent almost ten years as a monk—shaved head and all.”</p><p>        “And he keeps a familiar,” I said looking around for the cat, and not finding it.</p><p>        “And you learned how to use this energy?”</p><p>        “Yeah, some.”</p><p>        Now, my Momma didn’t raise no stupid children and I’m pretty sure Dave’s Momma didn’t either so we were still pretty skeptical.  “You trying to tell me that you ‘dark energied’ those dice?” I said.</p><p>        Once more he shrugged as he sipped the last of his whiskey.</p><p>        “Prove it,” Dave said.  “Do it again.”</p><p>        “And let me see the cup and the dice before you roll ‘em,” I chimed in.</p><p>        He nodded and set the cup in front of me. “Check ‘em all ya want. Roll ‘em if ya want. I won’t touch ‘em.  Bring your own next time if ya want.”</p><p>        I picked up the cup and rattled the dice around in it. It was just a round brown leather cup with five bone white six sided dice in it. I rolled ‘em out in front of me a few times, and they came out a mix. A couple of pairs and then three of a kind, then a straight.  I picked the dice up and held them up to the light to see if there was any kind of shadow on ‘em and when there wasn’t I rolled them out of my hand onto the table with the same results as when I was rolling them out of the cup.  “You wanna see ‘em Dave?” I asked.</p><p>        “Naw. I’ll trust ya.”</p><p>        I plunked the dice back in the cup and set ‘em in front of Irving. He shook his head and didn’t touch them.  “Go ahead and roll ‘em, so you can’t accuse me of switching dice.”</p><p>        I looked at him and then at Dave who shrugged and said, “Roll ‘em, G,”  which I did.</p><p>They galloped across the table and came up a full house like before.</p><p>        Dave shook his head. “Means nothin’” he said. “Might just be a regular roll.  Do it again G, only this time, Irving, you gotta call what is gonna roll up.”</p><p>        Schrödinger got an enigmatic little smile on his face and he lifted an eye brow. “Roll ‘em G,” he said.</p><p>        I rattled the cubes and as I dumped them he said, “ five sixes.”</p><p>        The cubes rolled and spun and turned up five sixes. Now at the best of times that would have been a damn near impossible roll. I mean the odds against something like that  would have to be astronomical.</p><p>        Dave and I must have looked pretty comical because Schrödinger started to laugh. Dave looked at him and then at me and scrapped the dice into the cup, rattled them around and dumped them and as he did Irving said, “all fives,” through his chuckles.</p><p>        Sure enough. All fives.</p><p>        “And you can do that every time?” I asked.</p><p>        “Most times.”</p><p>        Dave narrowed his eyes and squinted down his nose at Schrödinger. “Then why ain’t you rich? I mean, a man can control the dice like that you oughta be living in Vegas or Reno or something. Why ain’t ya?”</p><p>        “Couple of reasons. First off,  ethics.  I am pretty much a devote Buddhist. I still consider myself a monk though I let my hair grow back and I don’t beg anymore, but I renounced the world and its treasures.”</p><p>        “You’re a bar tender, Irving. Not exactly a job for a saintly Buddhist.”</p><p>        “I keep enough to eat on and pay the rent, but anything else goes back to the temple in China Town. Lots of poor people eat because of me and this bar.</p><p>        “But ethics don’t keep you from walking into an illegal casino in China town and skinning the owner for a chunk.” Dave said.</p><p>        “That’s where I know you from!” Irving said. “I shoulda remembered. But all of you Gaijin look alike.” He said and then went on,  “ Chin is a thieving bastard who sells “insurance” to the small business owners in China town so a little skinning is good for him, and the money goes to the temple to feed the poor. But not counting the little tithe I collect from Chin, there is also the fact that if I walked into a casino and walked out with lots of their money, especially if I did it more than once, I might wind up with my legs broken. Those guys don’t take kindly to people who ‘cheat’ them.  But I mostly don’t do it because of quantum mechanics.  You ever hear of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle?”</p><p>        We both agreed that we had heard of it, but didn’t exactly know what it meant.</p><p>        “Well, this ain’t exactly it since that deals with light waves, but it also deals with not being able to actually view a particle without changing it.  And, unlike a lot of these egg-heads, I believe that there are powers in the universe that sometimes like to play little tricks on us humans. What it really finally means to me is that, though I can control the dice nine times out of ten, there is still that tenth time when Professor Heisenberg steps in and the dice do what they wanna do, not what I tell ‘em to.”</p><p>        “Then God does play dice with the universe,” I said. “Unlike what that other professor said.”</p><p>        Irving laughed. “Maybe, maybe not, but I learned long ago that sometimes, no matter what you do, you can’t win.”</p><p>        Big Dave stood up again.  “If I don’t show up in Lake LA tomorrow morning bright eyed and bushy tailed I sure ain’t gonna win so, once more, what do we owe ya Irving?”</p><p>        “Not a damned thing, Dave.  But I would like to ask a favor.”</p><p>        I lifted my eyebrow at Dave and he shrugged. “OK, who do we have to kill?”</p><p>        “There are several people in and around China town who would love to know what I just told you.”</p><p>“Like your wizard friend?” Dave asked.</p><p>Irving shrugged, “These are not nice people.  So please do me the favor of keeping this all to yourselves.”</p><p>        “Ah man!” I began. “What the hell kind of deal is this? Great story that I can’t write about.”</p><p>        Irving was grinning like a Cheshire cat. “Sorry.  Maybe after I’m dead.”</p><p>        “I don’t think I’m gonna live that long,” I groused.</p><p>        “Good night, Irving,” Dave said. “Come on G. Let the man close up.”</p><br><br><p>        It was a couple of weeks before we got back to Pasadena. Dave got some extra work at Warner Brothers over in Toluca Lake and wanted to kinda celebrate so he said Schrödinger’s and I said OK . Michele was not that happy about it, but I pointed out that she had been gone chasing around with her friend Annoying Jen most of the week end before so maybe it was my turn. She grumbled some, but finally gave in, and I headed off over Angelus Crest.</p><p>When I got to the bar the place looked pretty deserted, but it was Thursday evening so I didn’t think much about it, just parked the silver bullet across the street behind Dave’s Harley and marched in on a Chinese gentleman a few feet from the bar nervously holding a sawed off shot gun on Schrödinger and Dave. He swung the gun around to point more of less in my direction and I just about shat myself.  I am not particularly afraid of guns; I even own one myself and I am a better than average shot, so I am not anti-gun, but I am anti-having guns with muzzles big as train tunnels pointed in my direction. I threw up my hands and tried to look harmless.  “I only got a couple of bucks and my watch, but you can have it all,” I said.</p><p>        “Get over there with them,” he said and waggled the gun barrel toward Dave and Schrödinger. I moved on across the room to the bar with my hands still up.</p><p>        “So, what’s up” Irving asked the gunman. “You want what’s in the cash register or what? Not much in there. Business is slow.”</p><p>        The gunman, not looking too certain, shook his head, waggled the gun barrel again and said, “Cousin Chin has figured out that you have been cheating him. He wants his money back, and he thinks you should start paying insurance like people in China town.”</p><p>        “I don’t have the money anymore,” Irv said. “I gave it all away, back to the people Chin stole it from.”</p><p>        The gunman took a deep breath and let it out slowly. He was sweating like a ditch digger and his hands didn’t look too steady. “Cousin Chin said you would probably say that, but he said I should maybe shoot you in the leg if you did until you came up with the money.”</p><p>        “I don’t have the money, and you can shoot me in whatever you want, but it is gone.”</p><p>        Dave was looking tense. Like I have said before, he is a very cool, very gentle man, but when he does get mad he is practically a force of nature. I was afraid he was gonna try taking that shot gun away from the other fella and maybe he was considering it, but about then Fam, the blue Persian did her appearing trick. She jumped up on a table to the right of the gunman. The shotgun swung toward the cat and Dave took the opportunity to make the two steps between him and the gunman, grab the shotgun and twist it away from us. The gun went off and I was sure we were gonna have cat fur and kitty guts all over the wall but Fam had apparently done her disappearing trick in time cause there was no mess except the smoking hole in the wall.  Dave hung on to the gun and I stepped up and planted a sloppy round house punch right on ol’ shotguns face. Must have had a glass jaw because he let go of the gun and went down like a bag of sand.</p><p>        “Hell of punch, G,” Dave said.</p><p>        “Yeah. Adrenalin.” I said and noticed my hands were shaking.</p><p>        Dave flipped open the shotgun’s breech and popped the shells out. “I think we better have some law here Irv.” He said</p><p>        Irv called the cops and we heard sirens in a couple of minutes.</p><p>        They talked to us, took our statements and hauled ol’ shotgun off to the calaboose, leaving Irv, Dave and I in the quiet. Irving went behind the bar and came out with that same bottle of Makers Mark and poured us each a shot.  “I knew I was pressing my luck the last time I went back to Chin’s” he said, “but the bastard just pissed me off taking money from widows and orphans and harmless shop keepers.”</p><p>        “Well, seems like he is gonna have his own troubles now,” I said. “If cousin Shotgun talks.”</p><p>        “He won’t,” Irving said. “He knows it would be worth his life to rat out Chin so he’ll go on to jail on the assault with a deadly weapon charge. Probably say he had come to rob the place but stuff went wrong.”</p><p>        “Where’s that leave you Irv?” Dave asked.</p><p>        Schrödinger shrugged. “Think I’ll shave my head again, and head up north.  I know a temple up there.”</p><p>“Probably a good idea,” Dave said.</p><p>        Fam, apparently unhurt and less shook up than any of us, appeared on the bar beside us. “You guys want a cat?” Irving asked.</p><p>        Dave picked up the cat and cradled her in his arm then stroked her blue gray back. “Sure,” He said.</p><p>        Then it hit me.        “Damn it Dave! Looks like we ruined another good bar.”</p><br><br><p>THE END</p>
