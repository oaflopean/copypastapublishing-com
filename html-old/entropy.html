<p>“Paracelsus I have heard rumors that you are able to control Time.”</p><p>The man sitting before me, Herr Dietrich Voluva, was completely covered with an expensive cloak and hood.  No part of his body showed. Even his hands were covered with fine silk gloves. He sat hunched and his voice crackled like that of an old man, but I knew he was not elderly.</p><p>        “Under certain conditions I have some control of time,” I said. “But it is very difficult—and very expensive.”</p><p>        “Expense is not a worry.  I have plenty of wealth. What I do not have is an heir to carry  the name Voluva down the ages.”</p><p>        I knew this was true. Dietrich Voluva was a very wealthy man and so long as his foundry fires continued to convert iron ore into sword blades and spear points he would stay wealthy, and there was no fear of that ever stopping, either the foundries or the need for weapons of war.</p><p>        “But heir’s are easily come by Herr Voluva. One can buy as many heirs as one wishes anywhere in Zurich.  Buy an infant and raise him. Give him your own name.”</p><p>        “I have thought of that, but it is not the same as producing an heir of my body.”</p><p>        “I can produce a love charm that will lure a thousand beautiful women to you. You can produce heirs to populate cities yet unbuilt, and it would be much cheaper and simpler than dabbling with time. ”</p><p>        “You might bring me a thousand woman, but it would do no good. One needs—functions to produce off spring and I have no – functions.”</p><p>        “Ah,” I said.  “I have magic for that too Herr Voluva.”</p><p>        “No, I fear that even the great Paracelsus cannot alter my –condition with anything as simple as a potency charm.  One must have—“ he stopped and shifted uncomfortably on the divan.  “I must tell you a story, before you can begin to understand.”</p><p>        “Certainly sir. But allow me to have wine and dainties brought, that we may be more comfortable.”</p><p>        “Ah, there is no need—“</p><p>        As if by magic my dwarf servant Rudolpho appeared in the room.  “Bring a flagon of wine from the cellar, and a tray of dainties,” I told the dwarf. “And be quick about it.”</p><p>        He bowed and left the room.  “With Rudolpho busy getting wine we will not be disturbed or over heard,” I said.</p><p>        “So.  I understand. You are a wise man.”</p><p>        “Now, on with your story.”</p><p>        He took a deep breath and began. “House Voluva has been in the Iron trade for generations. We have stayed at the forefront of the trade by making sure we know everything there is to know about the production of metals so all the sons of the Voluva family begin as apprentices in the foundries and do not move into positions of power until they know the business from ore to sword blade.  I started as a child shoveling cinders and stoking furnaces.  I was precocious and I learned very quickly. Soon I was in charge of iron batching and pours to begin the process of making iron into steel.  At the best of times it is a dangerous business. One must pay strict attention to the process. A moment of inattention can cost a life.</p><p>        “When I was young I fell in love with a girl. She was the daughter of one of the men who worked for my father. His wife was the body servant of my mother and Genevieve was constantly around the house. She was training to be a personal maid, but she was also training to be a wife and a mother. We practically grew up together. We played together as children and I believe our love began then, when we were children. But whenever it began, at sixteen it was all I could think of.  There was the lust of course, but that would not have been a problem. I could have any woman or girl I wished, but I wanted only Genevieve. I began sneaking into her bed almost before my balls dropped into place.  Consequently by the time she was fifteen and I was sixteen she was with child.  That would not have been a problem had she just been any servant girl.  We might have kept the child as a servant of the house or we might have sold the child into another indenture when it was old enough, but what could never happen was that the child be acknowledged as an heir to the House Voluva. I wanted to marry Genevieve which would legitimize the child, but my father would have none of it.</p><p>        My father and I fought many screaming matches about that. He swore that he would never acknowledge a lower class bastard as an heir and I swore that I would marry Genevieve making the child my legitimate heir.  We actually came to blows.  I was young and strong and hard from foundry work so the fight was short.  My father, who no longer worked in the foundries but did business, lay beaten at my feet.  ‘I will marry Genevieve!’ I swore standing over him.  He glared at me with his piercing blue eyes and slowly shook his head.  ‘The bitch was sent away this morning.’ He said. ‘You will never see her again, and if you try to find her I will have her and the whole family killed. House Voluva will never have a bastard for an heir!’  I stood over my father and was within an inch of slaying him, but my mother, who had heard all but not interfered, rushed in and stopped me.</p><p>        Eventually I left the old man still living. I did not know what to do and I knew his threat to have the whole family killed was not an idle one, but I could not simply let Genevieve slip away so I carefully began looking for her.</p><p>        Genevieve was constantly on my mind and worry for her safety often distracted me. As I said, handling molten iron is not a task for someone distracted. One day I heard rumors that Genevieve and her family had been seen in Basel and the joy of that took my mind away from the foundry.  I tried to hurry the pour and a splash of molten metal flew from the cauldron and over me.  I was burned over more than half my body from my face down my chest and onto my thighs.  I should have died. Most men burned so badly live only moments, but I—I lived, enduring months of agony and left with scars from my scalp to my knees. My Generative organ was burned off leaving only a stub to serve as waste disposal.  So, even if you brought me a thousand beautiful, fertile women it would do no good.”</p><p>        Voluva fell silent and when he did not say further I asked, “What is it you wish from me, Mein Herr? “</p><p>        Voluva stayed silent for a time collecting his thoughts, then said, “I loved—I love Genevieve. I want to go back and find her—or perhaps prevent her from being sent away by my father.  If I could go back knowing what I know now I would take her myself and hide her. My father died only a few months after my accident. If I could keep Genevieve hidden for those months I could marry her and recognize my child as my heir.”</p><p>        “—and perhaps prevent that moment of inattention that brought you such disaster.” I added.</p><p>        He lifted his head beneath the veil as though this idea had never occurred to him. “Yes, I suppose that is true, isn’t it?” he said.</p><p>        Rudolpho returned bearing a heavy tray with wine, glasses and fine hors dourvers.  He placed them upon the low table beside me then asked my guest, “May I pour for you, Mein Herr?”</p><p>        “Yes,” he said, his voice somehow different than  moments before. It was as though the thought of perhaps changing his being, and his body had lifted him.</p><p>        Rudolpho poured the blood red wine into a stemmed crystal glass and Voluva took it in his silk gloved fingers. He lifted the hem of his veil a little, brought the glass rim beneath it and tasted the wine.</p><p>        Rudolpho turned to me and I nodded for him to pour for me also. I took the glass and sipped, considering what I would do for and with Voluva.</p><p>        When Rudolpho was finished I dismissed him and began.</p><p>        “There are dangers in this, Mein Herr.  The amount of blood required, both yours and mine,  will be enormous.”</p><p>        “Blood?” He asked. He was ignorant of the need for blood in all true magic. Most people are, but without blood there is no magic, and blood is required from both magician and client.</p><p>        “Blood is required in all things magical,” I began. “Anyone who says different is a liar and a cheat.  But, blood is not the only thing that stands in the way. “</p><p>        “If you are worried about payment—“ he began rather testily, “I told you that is no problem.”</p><p>        “That is not what I was talking about Mein Herr. I am sure you can bring wagon loads of gold at a moment's notice, and it will take a wagon load in advance for me to attempt this, but there are other considerations.  When one manipulates the past it can cause changes in the present, and sometimes those changes are gigantic and not to the liking of the client.”</p><p>        “What sort of changes are you talking about?”</p><p>        “It is sometimes called ‘the butterfly’s wing’ effect. A butterfly a hundred years ago flaps his wing which causes a stirring of the air which sets in motion a wind storm that destroys half of Zurich in the present day.  There are possible consequences.”</p><p>        “But there are good consequences too, are there not? I might be restored whole and Genevieve might become my wife and produce an heir to House Voluva’s fortune?”</p><p>        “Not precisely. You, that is the younger you, may marry your Genevieve and change your history, but that will make no difference to you, the present you.”  I swept my hand to take in his whole being.  “And then there is the problem of clash. If you should meet the younger you it could cause a warp in the time continuum and perhaps destroy the world.  And of course there is entropy.”</p><p>        “Entropy? What is that.”</p><p>        I was not quite sure how to explain entropy but I began by saying, “Entropy is the ongoing build up of negative vibration in the universe.  This negative vibration levels everything sooner or later. All things that are hot become cold. Mountains are flattened and valleys fill. Sooner or later all that are alive die. That is entropy and entropy always increases.”</p><p>        “And what has that to do with me?”</p><p>        “Sending you back in time will double your entropy and doubling your entropy makes bringing you back--difficult. And there are other dangers. Your body may not be able to stand the power of the spell. It could kill you.”</p><p>        He nodded in reluctant agreement. “But if it does not I may be able to change my past? True?”</p><p>        “True.”</p><p>        “Very well. Then let us begin. What must I do?”</p><p>        “First that wagon load of gold, in advance.”</p><p>        “How much is a wagon load?”</p><p>        “Ten thousand talents. Certified and stamped.”</p><p>        Even through his covering veil I could see that the amount made him flinch, but after a moment he said. “Done. What else?”</p><p>        “When you have brought the gold you will return here so that I may begin drawing your blood. This will take two or three sessions as I will need at least a double flagon to mix the matrix.”</p><p>        “A double flagon! So much! How much blood is in a man?”</p><p>        “About eight flagons. That is why we must do this in more than one session.  And don’t forget that I must add a flagon of my own blood to empower the matrix. Magic costs the magician almost as much as it costs the client.”</p><p>        Again Herr Voluva was silent for a time, perhaps reconsidering, but finally he nodded and rose. “The gold will be here in a couple of days,” he said.</p><p>        ‘Very well. We shall begin the day it arrives.”</p><br><br><p>        I began preparing the matrices the following morning gathering the minerals and the plants I would use. Some of the material I already had stored in my pantry, but there were certain drugs that had to be decocted fresh each time. These were drugs that I would use to focus my mind and to dull Herr Voluva’s. He could not know what was being mixed, nor could he hear the words of power I would use.</p><p>        Into three beakers, two large and one small I put powdered seed of the plant called Everlasting. A simple plant found in most fields, but having multiple magic properties. Then I added  stones of appropriate size to each beaker. These stones were  from a mine far to the east and they were expensive. They were called Soul of Earth and were quite dangerous to keep. I kept a few stones of different sizes in my pantry, but I kept them in leaded canisters. Those who tried to keep them without such precaution developed sores and cancers which always led to painful death.</p><p>There were other things as well but I will not say exactly what, lest someone unversed attempt to create a matrix. Such power in the wrong hands is very dangerous. Think of them as toe of frog and eye of newt if you wish. I will say that one ingredient was a fern, called moon fern, dried and powdered. That fern had to be gathered just as it began to unfurl from the ground. If the frond was too far unfurled it was useless. That fern could be gathered only at midnight during a full moon in spring.</p><p>And then of course there was the blood.  I could draw some of my own and begin the mixing but I could not draw too much lest I become weakened. Nor could I draw it too early lest the blood coagulate and clump and sour. There were elixirs which could slow that process but nothing could stop it completely until the matrix was complete and it would not be complete until the blood of the client was mixed in and the words of power, the spell if you will, was cast.</p><p>To draw my blood I had long since set aside a special basin and tools which were used only when I opened my veins. These were all kept meticulously clean for I had seen what could happen to those cut with dirty blades. I tied a tourniquet around my left upper arm and twisted it tight allowing the vein at my elbow to fill and swell then I took a clean swab and washed my inner elbow. After a few moments I set my elbow down into the device, a cradle, which held it above the bottom of the receiving basin and pierced the now blue swollen vein with a sharpened bodkin. My blood arced forth in a small stream which almost shot past the edge of the basin, but did not. I allowed the blood to flow for a moment then released the tourniquet I had to milk the vein to draw more blood.  At last there was a considerable pool beneath my elbow.  I was beginning to feel rather light headed and knew that I must not allow enough blood to leave my body to cause me to faint.  I took a clean white cloth pad and pressed it tight against the vein and held it until the wound closed.</p><p> I carefully measured out the blood and put equal amounts into each of the two large beakers, a small cup full for each. Then I added a half flagon of distilled water and stirred gently pronouncing the words of power that began to bring the matrices to life. Into the small beaker I put only a few drops of blood and distilled water.  I sealed the small beaker tight then, holding thought of the master matrix which held my soul in my mind, I drew power from it and channeled that power into the small beaker.</p><p>A flash of light caused the beaker to glow red and become warm. The liquid inside seemed to draw together and thicken and I knew it was alive now and could do my bidding.</p><p>I brought forth a small metal box about a span in length and width and tapped my seal on top of it with a hammer.  Lastly I sat down at my desk with parchment, pen, and ink to write instructions to my younger self as to what was to be done.  As I wrote I had a chilling feeling of Déjà Vu. I remembered very clearly receiving the box twenty years before and how these instructions from my elder self set me on the path to wealth and true power.  I had know this day was coming, but now that it had arrived I had such a sense of unreality that I had to stop for a bit and drink a glass of brandy to calm myself.</p><p>When the letter was finished I folded it so that it would fit tightly into the box, only leaving room for the small blood matrix beaker.  I sealed the box with magic remembering how I had been puzzled at first when I received it as to how to open it, but with some wit I managed to pop the top open and read the instruction letter.  At last I held the box in my hands and concentrated on the small matrix telling it where to go exactly so that it would pop into being upon the table in my study of twenty years before. It was difficult task and by the time the box disappeared from my hands I was near collapse.  Sweat soaked my robes, my head pounded as though some demon incubated inside was trying to hatch. I discovered that I had bitten through my lower lip and the blood was dripping down my chin.</p><br><br><p>        Twenty years earlier I was sitting in my study when there was a POP in the air and a small box appeared upon the table near me. I rose and examined the box. It was a perfect cube a hand span wide and deep made of shiny tin with no mark upon it save my seal stamp on top.  I examined the box from all sides before I touched it.  It was obviously meant for me since it came directly to me so unless I had lost my mind in some other life the box was not a danger to me. At last I picked up the cube and gently shook it. There was the sound of something inside it, but there was no apparent latch on any edge of the cube.  I ran my finger down each corner of it and when I stroked the last corner the box popped open. Inside was a small glass vial, obviously a blood matrix, and some folded pages of parchment.  Written upon the pages in a spidery hand which I recognized as my own was a list of instructions.  Foremost was a command to contact House Voluva, specifically the eldest son Dietrich and persuade him to take a serving maid named Genevieve and run away.</p><p>        I stared at the letter for a long time. Clearly an older me had written it, but some of the instructions seemed odd, and some seemed drastic, but upon consideration I decided to go ahead and obey the instructions.  I wrote a request to meet with this Dietrich Voluva and gave it to my servant Hansel to deliver. “See that young Voluva gets this in his own  hand and make sure that he understands how important it is. Tell him that his life depends on our meeting.”</p><p>        Yes Master,” Hansel said and departed with the envelope in his hand.</p><br><br><p>The gold arrived the morning following. Rudolpho and I unloaded the cart, checking each ingot for the two stamps, one the certification of purity one the certification of weight. With the help of the driver the gold was carried down to the strong room and locked in, not just with locks and bars but with magic that would answer only to my hand.  In the afternoon Herr Voluva, accompanied by a servant arrived.</p><p>“Payment is sufficient?” he asked, trying to appear cordial as though this were just another business deal, but I noticed that his voice shook more than before and that the hem of his veil quivered.</p><p>“It is sufficient, Mein Herr. If you will follow Rudolpho he will show you where to go. We can begin with the first of the blood right now.”  I could sense hesitancy about him.  He had been thinking of this for three days and now was not quite sure he wanted to go ahead, but the deed was paid for already so he steeled himself.</p><p>“Rudolpho, take Herr Voluva to the study and make him comfortable. Bring wine.”</p><p>The dwarf bowed. “This way, Mein Herr,” he said and indicated the direction with a sweep of his arm.</p><p>I turned to the servant who had accompanied Voluva. “Your master will have to stay the night. Go home and report to whomever needs to know, and you come back here tomorrow morning. You should bring another man with you as your master may be weakened by the procedure and may need to be carried.”</p><p>The servant bowed and left. I went to my chamber and threw off my robe replacing it with one which had many power symbols embroidered upon it.  It had no magic power in reality, but it did give the appearance of power and I wanted to impress Herr Voluva.</p><p>In the study Rudolpho had seated Voluva in a large chair with wide arms. The instruments for bloodletting were placed upon a table nearby. The swish of my robes caused Voluva to start nervously, but I ignored his apprehension and without a word I took his right arm and stretched it out, folding back the wide sleeve so that I could place the tourniquet above his elbow.   The lower part of his right forearm was a mass of pink, white and red scare tissue, but the area inside his elbow was clear so that I could reach that large vein without difficulty.  I placed a basin and cradle beneath his elbow to catch the blood then I uncovered the two beakers with the beginnings of the matrices which had been sitting on a nearby table.  They held potential for life in them. I could feel in my middle that they were both ready for the enlivening blood from the man in the chair.</p><p>“What are those jars, Paracelsus?” Voluva asked.</p><p>“Those are the matrices by whose power and focus you will travel 20 years into the past. One will be the master matrix through which I focus my power. It will stay here in my storage room. The other will travel with you.  I have already added some of my blood and will add more as the very last ingredient.  Now I will take a half flagon of your blood to mix into it and bring it alive.  You will have to return three more times for I cannot take all the blood at once lest you die.”</p><p>He drew a short sharp breath and nodded.  “Go ahead,” he said.</p><p>I tied the tourniquet tightly around his arm above the elbow then tapped upon the dammed vein to make it puff up.  In a moment I stabbed the vein with my lancet and the blood began to flow. In a moment I released the tourniquet and the flow increased. Voluva had watched through his veil as I prepared to open his vein but when the blood began to flow he turned his face away. I feared for a moment that he might faint or vomit but he did not. His breath came in smaller gasps but he remained still and calm.</p><p>When the blood filled the basin up to the half flagon mark inside I pressed a clean white pad onto the wound and held it tightly.  “Rudolpho” I called and the dwarf appeared. “Hold pressure on this pad when I release it. Take that towel--” I indicated the large white towel, “and place it where the basin is when I remove the basin.”</p><p>“Yes, master.”</p><p>I lifted Voluva’s elbow from the cradle with my left hand, keeping pressure on with my right.  “Kindly hold your arm up Herr Voluva,” I said and he did.  I lifted the basin and moved it to the table beside the beakers.  “All right Rudolpho. Take over here. Herr Voluva you may relax.”</p><p>I opened one beaker and carefully scooped half the blood into it. At the first touch of that fluid the contents gurgled and moved as though it were coming alive.  I put the other half of the blood into the second beaker and it reacted much the same.  I poured a half flagon of distilled water into the basin, swished it around until the remaining blood was mixed into the water then divided the water into the beakers.  The matrices both gurgled and roiled as though being stirred from inside.  They were communicating one with the other and I could feel the warm buzz of their communication in my own veins.</p><p>After a time Herr Voluva’s vein closed and Rudolpho brought more wine and a bowl of thick meat soup for our guest.  The first session had gone well.</p><br><br><p>        The final day came a month later. That day Herr Voluva arrived alone. Rudolpho met him and escorted him directly to the study, where I already waited with the two matrices opened and ready.</p><p>        “This time Herr Voluva, the procedure will be a bit different. I must have you strip completely.”</p><p>        “But Why?”</p><p>        “Because when the final addition of my blood to the matrices is completed I will began the task of sending you back. It must be done quickly while the power of the matrices is at highest peak and I must reserve all my strength for sending you. I cannot waste power on sending your clothing.”</p><p>        “But I will arrive naked.”</p><p>        “Yes, but it will make no difference since you will arrive in this same room in this same chair twenty years in the past.  I remember it very well.”</p><p>        “You remember it? Then the deed is accomplished successfully?”</p><p>        “Yes Mein Herr. Now kindly disrobe. Rudolpho, bring a blanket to cover Herr Voluva against the cold.”</p><p>        “It is at the ready master,” the dwarf said.</p><p>        Voluva began to slowly disrobe, taking off his gloves first.  The scaring on his hands was terrible. The little finger of his right hand was burned completely away and the scar tissue was such that I do not believe he could ever manipulate anything with his hands. Even so, that scarring did not prepare me for what else I was to see. If I had not talked with the man I would not have believed he could have ever lived through the shock and pain of such injury. His scars did indeed stretch from the top of his head to his legs. That he was not blind was a miracle. His nose was burned off as were his lips.  There was no evidence of nipples on his chest or of sexual organs.  It was as he had told me earlier. I found myself looking away. He noticed.  “It is a sickening sight is it not? And what little skin is still covering me is so thin that it breaks at the slightest touch and becomes infected. I then spend hours in medicated baths to cure it. It is almost as though I am a leper.”</p><p>        When he was naked and seated again upon the chair I carried out the bloodletting. It was really too early to do this again, but he was anxious to have done as was I.  When the blood was drawn and the vein closed Rudolpho covered Voluva with the blanket. I must say that having the horror of Voluva’s body put out of sight was a relief.</p><p>        I divided the blood between the matrices, rinsed out the basin and handed it to Rudolpho to be put away, then put my own bared left arm into the cradle in my special basin and began concentrating on the words of power as I opened my own vein.  I began to feel the thrum of power in my midsection almost immediately, and the matrices began to roil and climb the sides of the beakers as though trying to be free.</p><p>        After a few moments I pressed the pad of white cloth over my bleeding vein. Rudolpho quickly wrapped another cloth strip tightly around to hold the pad in place and I carried the basin to the two beakers. Carefully I measured the blood equally into each matrix then rinsed the basin into them. The buzzing of power from inside me was almost audible to Voluva and the dwarf as I sealed the beakers.  I carried one to Voluva and when Rudolpho whipped off the blanket which had covered the old man I handed him the matrix.  “Hold to the container as though your life were in it, for it is.”</p><p>        Voluva took the beaker and clutched it to his chest. I focused my mind through the second matrix and , standing behind the chair, lay my hands upon his shoulders. The power trickled from my hands at first, but as I focused more deeply the power poured out like lightening from the clouds. It encaged the man, the chair and the matrix to which he clung crackling and roaring with a sound which seemed to shake the stone walls of the house.  The same pain which had beaten me when I sent the instructions back to myself once again gripped me and the agony was so huge that I almost released my hands from his shoulders but I clenched my jaw and gritted my teeth together so hard a tooth cracked. Then there was a sound like thunder in the room and Voluva was gone, leaving behind only a smell of scorched flesh.</p><p>        Suddenly my legs would no longer hold me and I collapsed.</p><br><br><p>        I was waiting with tea and a blanket when Herr Voluva burst through time into my study.  I took the blood matrix from him. He gripped the beaker so tightly I had to pry his hands and arms from it.  He was not in good shape. Blood oozed from some of his scars and he was having trouble breathing.  I brought an ampoule of ammonia beneath his nose which brought him fully awake and caused him to gasp for breath.</p><p>        “Where—“ he moaned.</p><p>        “Zurich, in the house of Paracelsus.” I told him.</p><p>        “Then it did not work?”</p><p>        “You are in Zurich twenty years earlier than the time from which you started.  My elder self has performed what I would consider impossible. Sending a living body through time and have it arrive still living is very difficult.”  I handed him the tea and encouraged him to drink.</p><p>        “What is this?” He asked after taking a sip.</p><p>        “An herbal decoction with ginebra. That is why it tastes of cedar. It is a restorative.”</p><p>        He drank more deeply and I refilled his cup.</p><p>        “All the things that the elder Paracelsus instructed me to do have been done.  The younger you and the serving girl Genevieve are away together hiding from your father. I made sure they were comfortable in Basel. If they follow instructions they will remain there for at least a year, at which time your—the younger you—his father will be dead of a heart attack.  Already he has begun to notice flutters in his heart as his cook has begun adding fox glove flowers to his soup. That was costly and will continue to be costly until the old man is dead. It will cost the cook more dearly than he knows. He is being paid, but he also has been promised that his wife and child will not be harmed if he does what he is told.  Of course his life is forfeit as it would not be neat to leave such a loose end to be pulled should anyone suspect his complicity in his master’s death.</p><p>        “But I must—“ Voluva began, trying to rise from the chair.</p><p>        “No Mein Herr, you must not.  Your wishes and commands have been carried out. Paracelsus, both I and the elder, have done what was asked of us and would have done merely by instruction, but you were adamant about returning to the now.  Paracelsus the elder told you that you could not be allowed ever to contact the younger you, or allow anyone save me of this time know that you are here from the future.  Consequently you can never be allowed to leave this chamber.”</p><p>        “You will send me back then?  I have given you enough gold to pay for you to send me back to my time.”</p><p>        “I am sure that my elder self explained to you about Entropy.”</p><p>        “He said it was difficult to overcome.”</p><p>        “Ah. The Elder Paracelsus has learned that truth is not always a fortuitous servant.  Entropy is not difficult to overcome it is impossible. Entropy always accumulates and can never be defeated. And, even if it could be overcome I would not send you back. It would not be a good thing to have both you and another elder Voluva which was also you co-exist. That would be disastrous. It would without doubt warp the time line and perhaps destroy us all.”</p><p>        “So I am to remain here?”</p><p>        “In a manner of speaking. The tea was not truly a restorative. It was hemlock.  That is why you are feeling weaker now.  You will be gone from this life in a few moments. I would have been simpler if you had died in transit, which is what I expected, or to have met you with a dagger driven into your heart should you have lived, but the elder me wanted to make sure you knew that your instructions had been carried out before you died. Hence the hemlock tea.”</p><p>        Voluva’s eyes had begun to take on the dull sheen of one near death. He swept his sight over me and breathed, “Many told me not to trust Paracelsus. That he would find a way to cheat me. I should have listened.”</p><p>        “Cheat you? He has given you everything you contracted for, plus an end to your pain in peaceful death. How is this a cheat?”  But it was too late. He could not hear my protests.</p><p>        That evening after dark, my servant Hansel and I carried out the body and dropped it into a pit filled with quick lime, just as the letter from my elder self had instructed.</p><br><br><p>        I opened my eyes and saw the ornately carved wooden ceiling above my bed. I did not know how I had gotten there. I was dressed in my night shirt and was comfortably warm beneath the coverlet. In a few moments I realized I was ravenous. I felt as though I had not eaten for days.</p><p>        “Rudolpho,” I shouted, and the dwarf appeared beside my bed quick as thought.  He looked relieved.</p><p>        “Master, you are alive!” he said. “I feared for your life when you collapsed after Herr Voluva disappeared.”</p><p>        “Ah, I understand. The spell cost me a great deal of power. No wonder I am starving.  Bring me meat, cooked rare, and wine.”</p><p>        Rudolpho bowed but did not turn to leave.  Instead he stood as though he had something to say but was afraid to say it.</p><p>        “Well, go and do as I told you,” I said.</p><p>        “Yes master, but--</p><p>        “But—“</p><p>        “Would it not be better for you to take something more, digestible first? You have had nothing but the water I forced down you for more than a week.”</p><p>        “A week? You have been caring for me more than a week?”</p><p>        “Yes, Master.”</p><p>        I looked at the little man wonderingly. He had nursed me when he might just as well have robbed me, killed me and run away.</p><p>        After a moment's thought I said, “Perhaps you are right. First porridge, then meat.”</p><p>        “Yes Master,” he said with a remarkably warm smile.</p><p>        “And while I eat you can tell me about House Voluva. Is it prospering? Do they have an heir?”</p><br><br><p>        Rudolpho seemed confused for a moment.  “Strange that you should ask that, master. Herr Voluva sent a servant day before yesterday asking after for an appointment to see you. He said he wished to introduce you to young Voluva who will someday be patriarch of House Voluva. I told him that you were ill but that you would send word if you wished to see him.”</p><p>        “Ah so, yes.” I let out a breath of satisfaction. Apparently the plan had gone well. “Send word to him, but not until after I have eaten.”</p><p>        Rudolpho again smiled that remarkable smile, bowed and said, “Yes, Master.”</p><br><br><p>ENDIT</p>
