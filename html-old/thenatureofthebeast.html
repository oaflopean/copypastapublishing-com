<p>            The television was nattering on about some new credit card when the telephone rang so I was glad to hit the mute button on the hand set to shut it up.</p><p>        \\"Hello. . .\\"</p><p>             \\"Jim?\\"  It was Arnie Kohl.  He sounded strange.  Tense.</p><p>             \\"You OK, Arnie?  You sound funny.\\"</p><p>             \\"Can you meet me at Malone's?\\"</p><p>             I glanced at the clock on the VCR.  \\"Hey buddy, it's after eleven.  Some of us gotta work tomorrow.\\"</p><p>             \\"This is important, Jim.  I mean real important.\\"</p><p>             After a moment's thought I said, \\"OK, I'll be there in fifteen--twenty minutes.  Have a cold one drawn and waiting for me. \\"</p><p>             \\"Make sure you aren't followed,\\" he said.</p><p>             \\"Followed?\\"  I asked, too late.  He had already hung up.</p><p>         I looked at the receiver and frowned.  \\"Followed?\\"  I said again.  \\"Boy must be hallucinating or something.\\"</p><br><br><p>             I hadn't known Arnie very long really, about a year, but it felt much longer than that.  We seemed to be on the same wavelength or whatever.  I met him at church -- St. Barnabus Episcopal.  Most of the congregation called it St. Barnies.  Arnie had just turned up one Sunday around Easter, but he wasn't one of the usual Easter crowd.  He was a short round fellow with sharp green eyes above the red beard that had taken the place of the hair on his head.  He came in and sat down in the pew in front of Pam, my wife, and me and when we passed the Peace we invited him to stay for coffee and donuts after the service.  He did and we found him so interesting that we invited him home for lunch.</p><p>               He was fascinating to listen to.  He was a free-lance writer who had traveled over a pretty good piece of the world, and he had a knack for seeing things in an odd sort of light.  If he hadn't been so lucid in his conversation I would have said he was a nut, but. . .</p><br><br><p>          I didn't see Arnie in the Bar until he stood up and flagged me.  He was all the way in the back at a table which had a full view of the front door.</p><p>             As I sat down he said, \\"Were you followed?\\"</p><p>             I blinked at him.  \\"You're kiddin' right?\\"</p><p>             \\"I'm not kidding.  Were you followed?\\"  There were beads of sweat on his upper lip though the room felt rather cool to me</p><p>             I shrugged and decided to play along.  \\"I don't think so; I mean I didn't look that much, but I don't think so.  Who would want to follow me anyhow? You OK, Arnie?  You look like you haven't slept in a week.\\"</p><p>             His grin flashed at me like a neon sign.  \\"Pretty close.  I've been on the move for three days.\\"</p><p>             \\"How come?\\"  I asked trying to sneak a look at his pupils to see if there was any chemical in there besides beer.</p><p>             \\"I made the mistake of writing a story that got published in NATIONAL Magazine.  They traced me through the publisher.\\"</p><p>             \\"They?\\" I asked.  \\"Who are they?\\"</p><p>             Arnie drew a deep breath and let it out slowly.  \\"I don't know if I should tell you.  I don't know if you'll believe me, and even if you don't you’ll still be in danger. \\" He raked his teeth over his lower lip nervously.  \\"On the other hand, if you don't know you can't tell anyone else,\\" he finished.</p><p>             \\"What?  Tell what?  Look, Arnie, you're scaring me buddy.  You get me out here in the middle of the night to tell me something, and then you don't want to tell me.  Sounds pretty nuts you gotta admit.  Just tell me what is going on so I can either go home to bed or call the men with the canvas tuxedo to come net you.\\"</p><p>             Arnie sipped at his half empty glass of beer, then centered the glass back onto the wet ring it had left on the table— considering.</p><p>        I let him cogitate for a few moments then said, \\"Well?\\"</p><p>             \\"All right, all right,” he said.  Then he drank down the last of his beer and started.  \\"You remember the other night when we were talking about the book of Revelation?\\"</p><p>             \\"Mark of the Beast and all that?\\"</p><p>             \\"Yeah.  The Mark of the Beast.\\"</p><p>             \\"666, right?  On the hand and the forehead.\\"</p><p>             \\"Right.  Except that the 666 is just a symbol.  It doesn't necessarily mean the number 666.  It is just a symbol of numbers in general.\\"</p><p>             \\"OK...So?\\"</p><p>             \\"So. . . the Beast is among us already.\\"</p><p>             The hairs on the back of my neck stood straight up and my jaw dropped open.  \\"The Beast is among us?\\"  I managed to say after a couple of tries.</p><p>             \\"Yes.  And it won't be long until the Mark becomes common place.  Lots of people have it already, or at least part of it.”</p><p>        I looked at him hard and said, “Is this a joke? Cause it’s too late for it to be funny.”</p><p>        “It’s no joke, I promise.”</p><p>        I just stared at him with my mouth open.</p><p>          \\"You're looking at me like I'm a rattlesnake, Jimmy,\\" Arnie said, smiling ruefully.</p><p>            I cleared my throat and tried to stay calm while thinking furiously what to do.</p><p>             \\"I'll admit,\\" he went on, \\"it is hard to believe, but it is the truth, so help me God.  I'm not nuts-- at least I think I'm not, and I have been followed.\\"</p><p>             \\"But, Arnie -- 'The Beast is Among Us?'  I mean come on.  You sound like some end of the world nut!\\"</p><p>            \\"Not real, Right?  Religious mania like the Koresh bunch.\\"</p><p>             \\"Well. . .\\"</p><p>             \\"But if you can believe in Christianity-- if you can believe in the Resurrection like you say you do-- how can you not believe in Revelation too?\\"</p><p>             \\"Yeah but. . .\\" and that was as far as I could get.  I did profess to believe, but this was something else entirely.</p><p>             \\"OK,\\" I said at last.  \\"OK.  Just for the sake of argument say it is true.  Who is the Beast?\\"</p><p>             Arnie rolled his eyes aside, and when I tried to catch them they shifted away again.</p><p>             \\"Arnie, it can't be any more nuts than the rest of it so give.  Who is it?  The President?  The Pope?  Secretary General of the UN?  Who?\\"</p><p>             \\"It's not a who, Jim, it's a what.\\"</p><p>             \\"A what?  What, what?  I mean—well, you know what I mean.\\"</p><p>             \\"It is an international consortium.  I mean a really BIG company.  It reaches everywhere, and I mean everywhere or almost, and where it doesn't reach yet it will reach within the next few years.\\"</p><p>             \\"OK fine-- so what company is it?\\"</p><p>             Arnie hesitated again and his eyes did their sliding away routine.  He picked up his empty glass and tried to suck another drop out of it before setting it carefully back in the wet ring again. Clearly he did not want to tell me, but there was no way around it now.</p><p>             \\"Jimmy,” he began.  “It is a classic paranoid fantasy, but you have to believe me.  This is no fantasy so help me.  It is true, with God as my judge, and because it is I'm in danger, and if I tell you you'll be in danger too.\\"</p><p>             \\"Just tell me already!\\"  I snapped at him before I could stop myself.</p><p>             He blinked at me a few times then said, \\"It's the Phone Company, Jim.  The Phone Company is the Beast.\\"</p><p>             I laughed.  I couldn’t help it.  \\"The Phone Company?\\" I started to get up.  “That’s it.  I’m going home to bed.  It was fun.  Ya got me, but it’s late.”</p><p>             Arnie reddened, but his eyes stopped sliding around and he looked right into my eyes when he said, \\"Yeah.  The Phone Company.\\"</p><p>             Something about that look made me sit back down.  \\"This is a joke right?  Very funny!  Hahaha.  Can I go home now?\\"</p><p>             \\"I told you it was going to sound nuts.\\"</p><p>             \\"Way too mild a word, Arnie.\\"</p><p>             \\"Yeah, and that is why it is going to work.  The pervasiveness of the Phone Company has been a joke almost since Bell invented it, and that has all been part of the plan.\\"</p><p>             \\"What Plan?  I mean come on, Arnie.  Bell invented the phone more than a hundred years ago.  And I thought the reign of the Beast was supposed to be seven years or some such, not a hundred.  Besides there's a thousand phone companies!\\"</p><p>             \\"More like hundreds and while they seem independent they are still all interconnected, and in the context of Revelation the seven years could mean any number of years.  It symbolizes the fullness of time when God's plan is completed.  And the invention itself isn't the Beast.  Even the company itself wasn't the Beast until a few years ago.\\"</p><p>             Arnie's eyes flicked from mine and he stopped talking abruptly.  He was looking toward the door and a tightness had come over him as though his chair had suddenly become hot.</p><p>             \\"What is it, Arnie?  Are you OK?\\"</p><p>             \\"Listen to me, Jim.  It doesn't matter if you believe me or not, just trust me, or humor me or whatever.  I’m telling  you that it is dangerous for you to be seen with me.\\"</p><p>             \\"What the hell?\\"  I started to turn to look at what ever had caused Arnie to go all jumpy.</p><p>             \\"No!\\" he said and reached across the table.  \\"Don't turn around!\\"  He grabbed my arm.  \\"Keep your back to him and keep your head down.  Thank God this place is dark.\\"</p><p>             \\"But, Arnie. . .\\"</p><p>             \\"Don't argue!  Just do it!\\"  He hissed, and the command in his voice took this from some silly joke to something serious.  It made my flesh crawl.</p><p>             \\"OK. I'm not moving.  What do we do?\\" I asked.</p><p>             \\"We don't do anything.  I stand up and make sure he sees me go out the back door.  You stay put.  When you see a guy follow me you move to the bar.  Order a beer and sip it slowly for about a half hour, then go home.\\"</p><p>             \\"But, Arnie—\\"</p><p>             \\"No buts!  Look, humor me, OK?  If I'm nuts so what?  What have you lost but a half hour and the price of a beer?\\"  His green eyes cut into me like scalpels.</p><p>             \\"All right, all right!  But how do I get hold of you.  You can't just drop this on me and split.\\"</p><p>             \\"I'll get hold of you if I can, but don't expect any phone calls.  One was too many.  Mean time remember—the Beast is among us.\\"</p><p>             With that he stood up and moved toward the back door.  When he was beside it he made sure to kick a chair a little so that it made some noise before he went out.</p><p>              I stayed put and in a few minutes a guy dressed in jeans and a sweater did indeed seem to follow Arnie out the back door.  It might have been a coincidence, but the guy did seem to be following Arnie.</p><br><br><p>             I didn't tell Pam anything about the Beast.  I told her Arnie was in trouble and wanted to talk. That was all.</p><p>             \\"You didn't loan him any money did you?\\" she asked, her cute face going hard.</p><p>             \\"No I didn't loan him any money,” I said with disgust in my voice.   “It wasn't about money.  It was about. . . stress.”</p><p>             She cocked a blond eyebrow at me, but let the subject drop.</p><p>             The whole idea was crazy, but my mind would let it go; and the guy had followed him; but that could have been coincidence; or the guy might have been following him for some other reason.  He didn't have to be a hit man for the Phone company.  And yet. . . .</p><p>             After a few days of turning this all over and over in my mind I picked up my Bible and re-read all the end of the world prophesy books.  Revelation, Daniel, Ezekiel, and all of them.  It made my mind whirl more, but there was a certain spooky logic in it all.  I could see how someone might be able to interpret what was happening in the world as being the fulfillment of a lot of those prophecies.</p><p>             But still. . . .</p><p>             I waited to hear from Arnie, but nothing happened.  Then I remembered he had said his story in NATIONAL Magazine had started this whole thing, so maybe the story could answer some of my questions.</p><p>             The magazine rack at the corner drug store didn't have a copy.  I thought that was a little strange, but maybe they had just sold out.  Good issue or something.  So I went down town to the big news stand.  It covered half a block and claimed to have every English language publication in the world.  That was a patent falsehood, but they did pretty well.  Anyway they would certainly have a NATIONAL.</p><p>             Except they didn't.  I searched for a half an hour and couldn't find the current NATIONAL. They had last months but there were no new ones.  I stood there looking at the cover of the old NATIONAL when the little old man who ran the stand asked if there was anything he could help me with.</p><p>             \\"I don't know,\\" I said.  \\"I was looking for the new NATIONAL, but you don't seem to have it.\\"</p><p>             \\"Yeah, only got last month’s.  Real strange, ya know?  I got the new ones about a week ago, but not more than an hour later this guy shows up and takes 'em all back.  I says how come, and he says something about a liable suit or something.  He gave me a couple hundred more of last month’s and refunded my money, but,\\" he shrugged and looked sour about the whole business,</p><p>“I can't even give 'em away.  Sure would like to have the new ones!  They always sell real good.  I sell maybe a thousand a month, but after a while the rest just sit there.\\"</p><p>             Chills ran up my back as I thanked him for his help.  Arnie had said his story had gotten him in trouble.  It looked like someone was making sure the trouble was contained. But it might not have anything to do with Arnie or the Beast, I tried to tell myself, but myself wasn't buying it somehow.</p><p>             I checked a few more stands and even the public library, but there was not a copy of NATIONAL to be had anywhere.  Arnie was looking less and less like a nut case, or I was looking more and more like one.</p><br><br><p>             \\"What's wrong, Jim?\\"  Pam asked a couple of days later.</p><p>             \\"Nothing.\\"</p><p>             \\"Don't tell me 'Nothing'.  You've been in another world for more than a week.  You'd forget to go to work if I didn't push you out the door every day.  Now what's wrong?\\"</p><p>             \\"Nothing, I told you.  I'm all right.  Now just leave me alone.  Please.\\"</p><p>            I could see concern in her brown eyes.  Concern and love.</p><p>             \\"That's all you have wanted for days, Jimmy.  You sit there in front of the TV and don't so much as move a muscle for hours on end.  What’s  wrong?\\" She was really worried about me and that made me feel lousy, but I couldn't tell her.  Either she would think I was nuts or, if Arnie was right, it might put her in danger.  But she had that pouty little girl look about her that I just can’t resist.             \\"OK, Pam.  I'll tell you, but it is going to sound crazy and maybe it is, I don't know.  Sit down.\\"</p><p>             She sat and I reached for the TV remote to turn the sound down, but as I hit the mute button I noticed the commercial that was on.  I had seen it maybe a hundred times over the last week. They were really pushing it.  It was very lively with lots of pictures of young couples traveling through the world.  The narrator was saying, \\"With good credit, the world is your oyster, and now you can have the best credit in the world.  International Bank and Trust Corporation has joined with International Telephone Corporation to bring you the World Card.  The first and only truly international Credit Card.  Accepted everywhere from Bangkok to Bayonne, and it is yours for the asking.\\"</p><p>             The last scene showed another beautiful young couple holding hands on a bridge in Venice.  They looked into the camera, smiled and said, \\"One world, one card.  What could be simpler?\\"</p><p>               With a horror which froze my blood I knew that Arnie was not a psycho.  I knew it was real and I knew what part of the Mark was.   I discarded my old notion about tattoos or other actual marks.  It had to be something as high-tech as credit cards.  Something with a gee-whizzy kind of fascination that would make people want it and believe that it was just another invention to make life easier or safer or better.  Maybe like a camera hooked into the credit computer or something.  When you used your credit card the camera would take your picture, feed it to the computer which would OK the transaction.  That would mean security in your dealings.  No more stolen credit cards.</p><p>             But somehow that didn't seem right.  Not astonishing enough or secure enough, but it had to be something like that.  Maybe a retina scanner or some such.  Not that it really mattered.  The point was that the Mark in the forehead could easily be accomplished under the guise of better security for credit card transactions.</p><p>             Pam's eyes grew more and more frightened as I told her what Arnie had told me, and about the magazine and about how this new international credit card was the beginning of the Mark.</p><p>             \\"That's insane, Jim!\\" she said, her voice quivering.  \\"Arnie has gone insane and he has infected you somehow.\\"</p><p>             \\"No, Pam, it is real!  The Beast really is among us now.  The Second Coming is near,\\" I said, trying to contain my anxiety.  \\"Pretty soon the Mark will be ready and in place.  We've got to warn people!”</p><p>             \\"Jim, that is the same thing all these end of the worlders are saying.  Some of them are violent and dangerous and if you start saying this stuff in public they'll put you in jail, or maybe an asylum.\\"</p><p>             \\"But other people are saying it too Pam!  Churches and TV preachers have been preaching the Second Coming since I was a child.\\"</p><p>             \\"Yes,\\" she said, trying to keep her voice from shaking.  \\"TV preachers.  The preachers you used to say you hated because of all the fire and brimstone they preached.  Pulpit pounders you called them.\\"</p><p>             \\"I know, I know, but maybe they've been right all this time.  I think maybe they have—\\"</p><p>             \\"Because of Arnie Kohl and his story about the Telephone Company?\\" she cried</p><p>             \\"Yes, that and all the rest.\\"  I reached out for her hand, but she jerked it away.  Her concern was turning to fear.</p><p>             \\"No, don't,\\" she said.</p><p>             \\"But, Pam. . . .\\"</p><p>             \\"No more!  I don't want to talk about it anymore,\\" she said and closed in on herself.</p><p>              After a little while she looked up at me.  \\"Jim, Will you do me a favor baby?  Will you go talk to someone?\\"</p><p>             \\"You mean like a Shrink?\\"</p><p>             She hesitated, afraid to go on, but after a moment she did.  \\"Yes, a psychiatrist or something.\\"</p><p>             \\"Pam, I am not a head case!\\"</p><p>             \\"All right, all right then.  If not a Doctor then to someone else.  Father Durin maybe . Will you go talk to Father Durin?\\"</p><p>             I could see the concern in her face; the pleading in her eyes.  \\"Father Durin?\\" I asked.</p><p>             \\"Yes.  He can help you work through this.\\"</p><p>I considered this for a moment.  \\"Yeah. Yeah maybe he can.\\"</p><p>             \\"I'll call him,\\" she said, hope replacing tears.</p><p>             \\"OK. Call him.\\"</p><br><br><p>             \\"Come in, Jim,\\" Father Durin said.  He was a tall skinny man made to look all the skinnier by his priestly dark clothes.  \\"Pam called a few minutes ago and said you would be here.  You want to talk to me I gather?\\"</p><p>             We went to the living room and sat down.  Mrs. Durin unobtrusively brought coffee and cookies and left, but it took no more than a glance to see that she knew all about my visit.</p><p>             I didn't bother with much preamble, assuming Pam had told him most of it.  I just sorta hit the high spots and cut right to the retina scan idea.</p><p>             Father Durin listened without comment.  I could see the disbelief, though he did a pretty good job of covering it.  When I finished he took several deep breaths, composing his answers thoroughly before he let them out.</p><p>             \\"Jim, this isn't the first time I have heard this story,\\" he began in a fatherly tone.  \\"Arnie came to see me a couple of weeks ago and told me a similar one, but even that was not the first time.  My roommate in Seminary used to kick around some of the same ideas.  They weren't new then either.  People since the time of Christ have proclaimed the advent of the end times. They've all been wrong.\\"</p><p>             I tried to interrupt, but Durin held up his hand to stop me.</p><p>             \\" I know, I know.  Just because a thousand zealots have said it before and been wrong doesn't mean Arnie is wrong, but consider the more reasonable proposition that Arnie is a sick man.  I mean, look at the facts.  He is a lonely, reclusive man who spends his life making up stories.  It isn't too hard to see that he might easily slip over the edge into a fantasy world sometimes, and if he slips over enough that world might become more real to him than the real world.\\"</p><p>     \\"But, Father, in the bar a man really did follow him out the back door.\\"</p><p>     \\"So what?  There could be a dozen reasons for that.  For instance, where are the toilets in Malone's?\\"</p><p>             I thought about it and remembered that the johns were out toward the back.</p><p>             \\"But it doesn't really matter,\\" he went on.  \\"Because you have named another cause of delusional behavior.\\"</p><p>            I didn't understand and said so.</p><p>             \\"Alcohol, Jim. It is the cause of more delusions than just about anything.  You said yourself that Arnie looked like he hadn't slept in a week.  And you met him in a bar.  How long had he been there before you came?  How many beers had he drunk already?  When he came to see me I thought he seemed pretty rocky -- as though he had been drinking.\\"</p><p>             \\"But Father, I've never seen Arnie take more than a beer or two in all the time I've known him.\\"</p><p>             \\"Have you been with him twenty-four hours a day?\\"</p><p>             \\"Well, No.  But—\\"</p><p>             \\"But me no buts, Jim.  Arnie could be a binge drinker too.  He might not touch a drop for weeks or months and then suddenly fall off the wagon.\\"</p><p>             I hadn't considered any of this before, and the way Father Durin laid it out made a lot more sense than the Mark of the Beast story.  Still, something in me could not let go of it.</p><p>        \\"Father, do you believe there will ever be a Second Coming?  Or a Mark of the Beast?\\"</p><p>               He took time to pour himself a cup of coffee and offer me one before clearing his throat to answer.</p><p>        \\"I believe there will be a Second Coming someday.  As to the Beast and the Anti-Christ I believe they have come and gone several times through history.  I think the latest beast was Adolph Hitler or perhaps Joe Stalin, or even Pol Pot.  All of them were distinctly Anti-Christ, and all had marks of one sort and another.  I believe we are now moving into the Millennium.  The thousand years of Peace Revelation promises.</p><p>             He said it with such conviction that I had to believe him.  Arnie was, after all, only a deluded, pitiful man fallen into Religious Mania, and that saddened me.</p><br><br><p>             The way home seemed a lot longer than the way down had been.  I almost regretted that no thrill of fear went through me when a telephone truck drove passed me and slowed for a moment.</p><p>         Pam met me at the door.  She was smiling gently with just a hint of sadness.</p><p>             \\"Father called?\\"</p><p>             She nodded.  \\"I wish there was something we could do for Arnie.\\"</p><p>             \\"Yeah, me too.\\"</p><p>             On the table beside the door lay a little pile of mail.  Pam usually opened it all, but today she hadn't-- to distracted by her nutty husband.  I picked up the pile and began sorting through it.  Mostly junk mail, but among the ads was a long manila envelope, hand addressed with no return address.  It was from Arnie.</p><p>     \\"Dear Jim:</p><p>     By now you have no doubt come to the conclusion that I am insane, but let me assure you, I am not.</p><p>     I have also come to some conclusions.  The news that the Second Coming is imminent is not something I cannot keep to myself.  I would be shirking my Christian duty if I did not share this knowledge with as many people as possible.  I have no desire to stand before the Throne of Judgment and tell Almighty God that I knew, but kept the knowledge to myself.</p><p>     I am not sure how I will do this.  I considered trying to take over a TV or radio station, but, besides the danger to innocent people that would entail, I don't think it would work.  The transmissions would most likely be cut off before anyone could hear it . But, whatever I finally decide, you may be sure that my life is in danger.  I cannot tell you what to do, but I urge you to tell as many as you can so that you may stand before the Risen Lord and hear him say 'Well done thou good and faithful servant'.</p><p>                                  Love and Prayers,</p><p>                                       Arnie \\"</p><p>             I read the letter several times, and handed it to Pam.  She took the letter and read it.  \\"Poor Arnie,\\" she said.</p><br><br><p>        Days passed. I kept my eye on the mail, but no further word came.  I worried about Arnie and prayed for him—prayed that he would come to his senses.  He was never far from my thoughts so I was more than a little shocked when I heard his name coming out of the mouth of the channel 10 Newscaster.</p><p>             I called Pam out of the kitchen and we watched as the newscaster explained that an itinerant street preacher named Arnold Kohl and twenty other people had been killed in a bizarre auto accident.  Arnie had been preaching his end of the world gospel in McArter Plaza.  A considerable crowd had gathered to listen when an employee of the International Telephone Corporation who was driving his company truck, had been struck by a heart attack.  The truck had careened off the street, across the plaza and into the crowd around Arnie.  Twenty of them, and Arnie, were dead, and many more were injured.  The driver was in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit of County Medical Center.  He was not expected to live.</p><p>             Pam and I looked at one another with open mouths as the news faded and the beautiful pictures of the world and the beautiful people in it danced across the screen.  At the end the beautiful couple on the Venice bridge smiled their sincere smiles and said, \\"One World, One card.  What could be simpler?\\"</p><br><br><p>THE END</p>
