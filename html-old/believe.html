<p>There was the resounding click. Followed by the flickering as the bulb fought to capture the spark. Then the light expanded, cone shaped, like what you would see in B movie interrogation rooms. The light caught Jo just right as she hunched over her broadcast set up, matter of factly taking in her essence as she stared into a blinking screen.</p><p>Goth bob over pale vampire skin. Perky tits pushing forward through the tattered remains of a Ramones T shirt. If the screen went any lower, it would reflect that she was naked from the waist down, her body curled snake like around a squeaky revolving chair that had done more damage to her extremities than anything the CIA could dream up.</p><p>Jo smiled as she adjusted the dials and amped up the frequency. On most occasions men would find her eminently doable. But most men, or women for that matter, were not what her audience was all about which was why sex for her was anonymous hookups in faraway places. She never gave her real name. They, most likely, did not give theirs. She had one rule. No cameras. No cell phones.</p><p>And yes, she did frisk them.</p><p>Because distrust and disbelief was what Jo was all about.</p><p>Jo grabbed the monster of a microphone, something left over from the Cretaceous age of technology and gave it a few love taps. The sound levels were spot on. She glanced up through the darkness to a far wall where the luminescent numbers of an old style industrial clock showed 11:59. Jo reached across her console, took a final drag on a smoldering cigarette and tamped it into an overflowing ashtray.</p><p>The clock went twelve midnight, straight up. It was showtime.</p><p>Jo moved to within inches of the microphone and whistled a raw, erratic snippet of The Twilight Zone theme music into it, then segued into a high pitched hum that reached its peak in a bloody banshee scream.</p><p>“Good evening my children,” she cooed into the radio either. “Welcome to The Land Beyond Beyond. The place where trust is a myth, conspiracy is the life blood and belief is what you make it because you know better than everybody else what is truly out there. I’m Jo. Or at least that’s who you think I am.”</p><p>Jo twisted another knob hard to the right, sending a squeak and squeal out along the airwaves. She slammed the dial down to the left as the static slammed to black. Jo’s mouth smoothly caressed the metal appendage.</p><p>“Talk to me my children,” her tone a breathless whisper. “Tell me your dreams, your wishes, your magic tales. Tell me what you believe and disbelieve. Don’t be shy my pets. We all dwell in dark places. We have nothing to fear.”</p><p>Jo was greeted by silence. Ten minutes into her show and there was nary a sound. She knew they were out there. But, she sighed, she also knew that for a long time there had been nothing to say.</p><p>“Come on,” she softly admonished. “Give me something. A memory of the times. A theory that only a few of us understand. Is there anybody out there? Did the world suddenly end what you believe.”just before I came on the air? That’s it. It’s apocalypse now. Most of us are atomic ash. But I’m sure a few of you made it to the bunkers. Tell me what you see. Tell me what you hear. Tell me</p><p>Ten minutes later and still nothing.</p><p>Jo reached for the pack and another death stick. She lit up and dragged deep. She leaned back, her creaky chair emitting a raw death rattle amid the silence. Her body passed easily out of the light and into the dark and remembered the time when fantasy and reality were abroad on the land.</p><p>The Loch Ness Monster, UFOs, Bigfoot, The Kennedy hit in Dallas. People gathered to speculate, to explain and, most importantly, to believe and not believe. They believed in a conspiratorial way. They knew the truth as nobody else did. Area 51, Chupacabra, Bat Boy, the screams of Hell heard coming from the center of the earth by a passing Russian freighter.</p><p>Their mantra was the possibilities that lurked in the darkest corners of the night.</p><p>Their numbers grew. They were the isolated, the socially inept, the just plain psychotic and crazy. But they all found a common cause, refusing to believe and not believe what the status quo insisted was right, good and just plain not there.</p><p>Jo mentally marveled at how their numbers had grown to legions over the years. They came together at larger and larger unions. They seriously recounted how they had been abducted by aliens and nobody laughed. They listened intently as the rancher proudly proclaimed that he had a live dinosaur roaming his back forty. One woman claimed she had seen the bodies of the Roswell aliens. Another said her morning toast had an image of Elvis in it. There was the earnest, overweight and excessive—sweating nerd who always dressed in a suit and who, through endless books and speaking engagements, had convinced his believers that the death of Kennedy and the 9/11 attacks were the work of rogue CIA operatives known simply as The Blacks.</p><p>Jo was one of them. The unexplainable had been her companion from an early age. It had been ingrained in her DNA to believe only in fantastical possibilities. She was big on cryptozoology and had even claimed to have seen a Bigfoot during an outing in her teens. Reality did not get her through the day. The truly unbelievable did.</p><p>And so begot The Land Beyond Beyond.</p><p>The show began life as a microscopic watt on the far left side of the FM dial. The format was simple. Tell me your stories. I will not judge. I will believe. The premise was so different from anything else on the dial that it soon picked up steam and the all important ratings. As the guide, listener and sympathetic conduit to the unknown, Jo was a natural, her teasing, prompting and somewhat sultry tones were ideal for late at night, for an audience that most perceived as emotionally marginalized from the workaday world.</p><p>Callers had found their savior. Their tales of encounters, sightings and personal beliefs about what the government was really adding to the water morphed into a campfire roundtable of the airwaves. Experts were not shunned but were rarely given more than cursory time to hawk their wares. It was what the people calling in from darkened rooms, trucks barreling through the night or dealing with age and loneliness by calling Jo and telling her what they knew that was important.</p><p>The Land Beyond Beyond soon went viral and became an internet sensation. It was not long before syndication came calling and Jo was able to quit her day job as a barmaid in a low rent strip mall dive and turn up the frequency on what was really important, to her and to them. And then something really strange happened.</p><p>The Loch Ness Monster flippered its way out of the depths and onto a loch side dune and sunned itself in front of more than fifty astonished tourists, all of whom had cameras, before casually turning and sliding easily back into the loch. Long story short, yes it was a Plesiosaur.</p><p>Right in the middle of an overcast Washington D.C. morning, a UFO, doing its best The Day The Earth Stood Still imitation, settled down on The White House lawn and over an advanced sound system that reportedly reached around the world, it broadcast in perfect English ‘Take me to your leader.’</p><p>Bigfoot made an unexpected entrance at a mountainside mom and pop store in the Pacific Northwest. Locals captured it and were astonished to find out that, through primitive sign language, they were eventually able to communicate with it. The creature, a very Neanderthal looking thing, was surprisingly cooperative, letting the human race know that they had been around since before The Ice Age and, to the shock of many, had become more human than human by mating with modern day women. The sound the world heard was that of a million anti evolutionists hitting the floor. But there they were, brothers and sisters under the same hairy skin.</p><p>Jo took another languid drag and laughed softly into the night. The Philadelphia Experiment. Invisibility tests on big ships to aid the war effort. Nobody believed it, until some yahoos with metal detectors scoping a stretch of land near the legendary naval base struck something very rough, metallic and invisible. A year later a researcher with sensitive fingers discovered it was the ship’s title plaque, etched with the words Eldridge. The jig was up.</p><p>The Kennedy Assassination. After nearly sixty years of fingering everybody from Castro to the CIA to the janitor who emptied Congress’s ashtrays turned up nothing but a billion words of speculation that indicated everybody on the planet really knew who blew JFK’s head off. Who would have thought the French and the Swedes were capable of such a thing? But a deathbed confession took care of that one.</p><p>Within a couple of years, all of the great mysteries that had eluded hard science for centuries and gave true believers a reason to get up in the morning had been proven. The world was in amazement, tying itself in and out of emotional, sociological and political knots. The people who listened to Jo’s show puffed out their collective chests.</p><p>Jo’s ‘children’ had been right all along. Their withdrawn, desperate lives had been worth something after all. But their triumph was short lived, because soon there was nothing left to believe in.</p><p>More often than not, The Land Beyond Beyond had evolved into an immature bitch session with thinly veiled discourses on how letting all the true mysteries out of the bag had been the devil’s work or a plot by the Illuminati to strike at the very fiber of humanity. But soon things changed. The calls into the show had turned into rambling, often psychotic and thinly disguised cries for help. The people whose questionable lives hinged on the drug of belief had suddenly had their drug taken away from them.</p><p>And most were not detoxing very well.</p><p>The calls were tinged with alcohol, coke and meth. Jo could tell. And any doubt that many in Jo’s listening audience had replaced pure belief with pure heroin was removed one night when one of her regulars, a gentle soul who claimed he was Jesus and that it was a heretofore unknown twin brother who actually died on the cross, called up and, in a mumbling monologue, described in detail how he had just scored some pure shit, was digging around in his arm with a spike to find a virgin vein and finally jammed the horse into an obliging line. Jo was just a touch freaked but listened intently as Jesus described how the blood had surged up into the syringe before a moment of orgasmic relief and, finally, there was the sound of his body hitting the floor.</p><p>Jo was momentarily speechless but not without a sense of dark irony. “Ok. I give that a 7.5 for originality. If you can top an OD give me a call.”</p><p>And they did.</p><p>The woman with many alien abductions under her belt called in. The line crackled with crisp, thin static, a sign that the caller was outdoors. The caller was tearful. She sounded high. Or was it a final sigh of resignation that she was now dealing with a reality that did not include her ideas about UFOs, sea monsters and men in black. Jo listened as the woman jabbered incoherently about how the aliens were coming for her. They had instructed her to jump high, wide and far and that they would catch her in their interceptor and take her aboard the mothership for a ride home. After a moment of silence, there was a low whisper “goodbye”.</p><p>The New York Tattler led with the story the next day. Woman Takes Suicide Solution In 20 Story Leap.</p><p>Jo sighed and smiled tightly as the silence in the night continued. As did the memories.</p><p>She recalled a fairly regular caller who called himself Rod who would regale her listeners with tales of how H.G. Wells’ The Time Machine was based on fact and that he had spent years of researching and fine tuning what he would one day unveil to the world as the first actual time machine. Two years after the ‘Time of the big discoveries’, with the calls coming fewer and further between and bordering on extreme nut job, Rod called in.</p><p>There was excitement in his voice. He had finally figured out what made time work, had put all the elements into the engine of a 1967 Mustang and was about to rocket out of the present and into the future. The revving of the engine shattered the airwaves. A screech of transmission and Rod was off. Those who listened called in with enthusiastic encouragement. Rod reported in one more time. The speedometer had just hit 105. By his calculation, another 20 miles and he would pass through space and time. Finally, he reported with much excitement, that he had just hit the magic number. He gave a manic cowboy ‘yeehaw’ as he rocketed through space and head on into the 9:25 express coming in from Oshkosh. There would not be enough left in the wreckage to identify the remains. Jo would silently hope that Rod had truly made it and was somewhere in the time to come.</p><p>Jo was certain that the demise of those who suddenly had nothing left to believe in had not always been so dramatic. Most probably died alone in their rooms on the business end of a gun, straight razor or a bottle of downers. Some were probably cop assisted suicides. She was certain a lot had become institutionalized. They were the lucky ones. Jo feared that the vast majority were still out there, walking the streets, searching in vain for something to believe in. And doing who knows what in the process.</p><p>She wished them luck.</p><p>Jo leaned back into the stagnant cone of light. She hunched over the microphone. The Land Beyond Beyond was going on 45 minutes without a sign of life. It was time to bring up the heavy artillery.</p><p>“So you have nothing to say?”, she feigned in boring disgust. “Maybe this will loosen your tongues. From now until I sign off, you will have to contend with ‘In A Gadda Da Vida’, the extra long version on a never ending loop. The only thing that will save you from this torment is a call. Insult my ancestry. Talk about shape shifters that are hiding in your flower bed. Give me something people. Here comes hell!”</p><p>The haunting keyboard intro and the fuzzed out guitar heralded the arrival of one of the most obnoxious songs ever created by man. Jo pulled a tattered roach out of her pocket and lit up. Then she leaned back into the darkness to enjoy the ride.</p><p>One hour and four and a half plays later. Then out of nowhere came a blip on the screen. It was brief, faint but persistent. Crank calls and hang ups usually did not register that kind of fingerprint. Jo knew the difference because she could remember how, before everything in the night was suddenly out in the open, she would have those kinds of signs lined up around the block. Jo took another drag and pressed some buttons.</p><p>“It’s Jo. You know the drill. Talk to me.”</p><p>“First off I hate In A Gadda Da Vida,” said the low sinister male voice. Jo smiled. “Yeah everybody’s a critic. It’s your dime.”</p><p>“The name’s Deep Throat. Yeah, I know. But I’m the real Deep Throat.”</p><p>Jo stifled a laugh. Making fun of a caller was a no no in this business. “I’m listening.”</p><p>“I used to work for the space program. You know the Armstrong first man on the moon?”</p><p>Jo played along. This was the first live wire she’d had in almost six months.</p><p>Deep Throat hacked out an aged, rasping cough. Well what the world does not know is that there were four astronauts on that mission. Three came back. Need I say more?”</p><p>Deep Throat clicked off. Jo relit the stub of her joint and inhaled. What a rush. She barely had time to exhale before another blip of a caller made its presence felt.</p><p>“I was diagnosed with terminal cancer 18 years ago. I’m still alive. The pharmaceutical industry is trying to shut me up because what I know could put them out of business. I can’t say much more at this time because my line is constantly tapped. Click.”</p><p>There was a flicker of hope in Jo’s blitzed expression. Was there a second wave of whacked out believers out there waiting to make their move? Over the next hour, the calls began to once again take hold on the possibility and impossibility of it all.</p><p>A scummy stock broker made a deal with the devil and claimed he had the entire transaction on video. A left wing nut literally screamed that he had proof that the head of the National Rifle Association had a criminal record a mile long. A right wing wacko balanced the ledger when he claimed that the scripture clearly outlined how liberal thinkers were the spawn of Satan. Jo was convinced that desperation and the futility of life for so many had brought her people back. Quite simply, it was believe or perish.</p><p>The rest of the show raced by with waves of argumentative, rational and irrational ravings. It was like the time before the discoveries dampened the spirit. Everybody was right and everybody was wrong. Which is the way it should be.</p><p>“Okay my children,” Jo enthusiastically crooned out into the airwaves. “It’s good to have you back. We’ve got time for one more call. Zelda welcome to The Land Beyond Beyond.”</p><p>“Oh am I on? I know you’re running out of time so I’ll make this quick. My name is Zelda and I come from the future. You are going to die in ten days. Just thought you’d like to know.”</p><p>Jo faded the show out in an abrupt shock of static. She leaned back in her chair and contemplated what might be a limited future. She could believe or disbelieve. She was content to just let it play out. One thing was certain.</p><p>If Jo was around on day eleven it would be one hell of a show.”</p>
