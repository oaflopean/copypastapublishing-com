<p>   I was sitting in my favorite watering hole late one evening sipping beer, hiding from home and wife and feeling more sorry for myself than usual when I noticed there was a gypsy looking kid a few stools down that kept staring at me.  It made me nervous.</p><p>I say “kid,” but he was really a young man, eighteen or twenty maybe.  That made me even more nervous.  Young men looking me over. . . Why couldn’t it be a young woman?  If a young woman were to give me the eye the way this kid was I would be putty in her hands.  She’d probably shear me right down to my socks but it would have been worth it</p><p>for the sake of that look…</p><p>        The gypsy kid’s eyes were black as outer space, made all the blacker by the dim lighting in the bar.  They bored into me.</p><p>        “What you want kid?” I demanded at last.</p><p>        Caught staring, he looked away quick, but in a moment he looked back at me as though his eyes were drawn by a magnet.</p><p>        “Look, I’ll buy ya a beer if you’ll just quit staring at me.”</p><p>        “Sorry man.  I don’t need a beer it’s just—</p><p>        I waited a moment for him to finish what he started to say but he didn’t so I said,</p><p>“So what the hell is it?  You don’t want a beer and I ain’t looking for companionship cause you ain’t the right sexual persuasion, so what the hell is it?”</p><p>        He took a deep breath and let it out, then stood as though it hurt him.  He came over and sat down on the stool next to mine.  “I am a seventh son of a seventh son,” he began.  “And I sometimes see the future of strangers.  You have an aura about you that tells me I can see your future, or at least part of it.”</p><p>        “Oh brother!  I’ve been scammed by the best, and that is the weakest lead line I ever heard.  Future!  I don’t know that I got a future.  All I got is a past.  A not very illustrious past.  Not even a very interesting past.  What’s this sight into the future gonna cost me?”</p><p>        He shook his head and his longish black hair jiggled a little.  “I just need to see your hand—the left hand.”</p><p>        “How come you couldn’t be a good looking chick-a-dee wanting to hold my hand?”</p><p>        He didn’t answer or make any move toward me, just sat as though he could sit forever, patiently waiting for me to stick out my paw, so I did.  He traced his finger over the lines in my palm then looked into my eyes.  “You consider yourself a great failure because you have not succeeded at what you do.  You have created worlds that no one wishes to understand.  You feel as though no one understands you or cares about you.  Is this true?”</p><p>        I blinked at him several times.  “You been reading my mail?”</p><p>        He did that same slow shake of his head and said, “Your palm.”</p><p>        I just looked at him.</p><p>        He took my hand and turned it so that the light of the back bar brightened it a little then traced the curving line that ran from just below my index finger down the center of my palm to the heel of my hand, but his finger stopped just above the heel at a point where the line divided into two.   “This is the life line and you have reached, or will very soon reach this point.  Your life is about to change.  You will be offered a choice that will change your direction completely.”</p><p>        After a moment of looking into his eyes I said, “So what is this change?  Is it gonna be for better or worse?  Am I gonna sell a story or what?”</p><p>        “I cannot see that.”</p><p>        “What good are ya then?  If you can’t tell me something I don’t already know, what good are ya?  My life changes day to day so what have you really told me?” I pulled my hand away from his grip and sipped beer.</p><p>        “The choice will decide if your life will be long or short.”</p><p>        “Means nothing.  I could make it short by just walking over to the highway overpass and jumping off.  That would shorten it up considerably.”</p><p>        “Hey you guys,” Roy the bartender said coming toward us.  “You guys wanna be queer that’s fine with me, but go someplace else to hold hands.”</p><p>        “Fuck you, Roy.  No self-respecting queer would come in this joint.”</p><p>        “Fuck you back, Geoff.  Get outa here.  I’m closing up.”</p><p>        I looked at the gypsy kid.  “What do I owe ya for the bullshit?”</p><p>        He didn’t seem offended at my calling his predictions bullshit and said, “You owe me nothing.  I don’t tell fortunes for money.  I only warn people when they have reached an important place in their lives.”</p><p>        “And does anyone take you serious?”</p><p>        He shrugged.</p><p>        “So why do it?”</p><p>        After a moment’s hesitation he smiled with a mouthful of even white teeth.  “Karma,” he said then turned and left.</p><p>        About to change, huh? I looked at my palm.  Probably bullshit anyhow.  But somehow I just wasn’t so sure.</p><br><br><p>        A couple of days later I flopped into my desk chair and called up my e-mail.  I figured it was going to be an exercise in patience since most of what I had gotten lately was spam.</p><p>        In the Canterbury Publishing in box– the name of a shoestring publishing company I run—there was the spam I expected.  A couple that wanted me to come watch the sorority house girls’ shower, a couple trying to sell me drugs of dubious provenance and a couple that wanted to refinance my house.  I didn’t even open them—just hit the spam button, and then I came to the last one.  It had the little package with a magnifying glass picture that usually means spam, but it was marked as coming from someone named Cassandra @ hotmail and in the RE box it said, “Help.”  I didn’t know anybody named Cassandra and I was used to opening stuff like this only to find spam weight loss plans or other junk but, though I am a pessimist, I am hag ridden by hope, so I opened it.</p><p>The message started out  “Dear Mr. Chaucer . . .” That was a small shock because the e address I use in this case is strictly Canterbury Publishing with no reference to who I am.  Now it’s no stretch to think of Geoffrey Chaucer when you think of Canterbury, and my connection with the company isn’t a secret, but generally I don’t just tag my name onto it; but maybe this Cassandra had gotten my name from someone who knew me so I kept reading.</p><p>“I think I’m a writer. . .” it said.  “I have thought it for a long time and I have even written some things, but never for publication.  But the urge is growing stronger and I am afraid, so I don’t do anything but stew.  I’m stuck.  I found your name attached to a thing about writers’ workshops in a search engine.  I don’t know why I am writing you, but what I want is for you to encourage me or discourage me or something because this being stuck in limbo between will and won’t is driving me crazy.  Help!”  It was signed Cassandra.  No last name, no location, no other explanation at all.</p><p>“Hmm,” said I, and scratched my chin.  “That’s kinda weird.”  But since I am the director of a writer’s group—no great shakes really, just a bunch of writers that get together to talk and read to each other—I decided to answer this Cassandra.  I gave her the usual bit that I give anyone who comes to the group with vague literary desires, i.e.  “Get out while you still can, but if you must write remember, you aren’t ever going to get rich.  Write every day no matter what.  Be prepared for truckloads of rejection. . .” in example of which I whipped out my ‘I kept my first thousand rejects, but there are ten thousand more decorating trash heaps all over the world’  story, and ended with:</p><p> “It’s hard, lonely, frustrating work better left to damn fools like The One Geoff Chaucer, ne’er-do-well scribbler and shoe string publisher.”</p><p>        I finished up by politely inviting her to come and sit in on a session of the workshop if she were anywhere near Phoenix.</p><p>        With my mouse pointer poised over the send button I started wondering about this Cassandra.  Leave aside her literary aspiration, what was she— and did she have anything to do with gypsy palm readers?  Probably four feet four, spherical, seventy with a tendency to drool and covered with warts, each sprouting its own wiry gray hair, I thought.  Not that that would have been bad—I mean everybody got a right to live and if they are foolish enough to want to try to write – well, OK.</p><p>And then I thought, Would be nice though if she was about twenty five, five ten or eleven, shoulder length blond hair, blue eyes, long legs, has read maybe some of my poetry and loved it and is half in love with me already just from my writing.</p><p>Like I said, hag--ridden by hope. “Like you’ve ever had that kind of luck, Geoff!”  I said and sent the e-mail.</p><p>        Next day I got another e from Cassandra thanking me for taking time to answer a strangers questions.  She added,  “I have found some of your poetry on the Internet and I find it fascinating.  Have you written much poetry?”</p><p>        A little shiver ran up my back as I answered.  “Depends on what you mean by much.  I’m assuming you know that I’m not the original Geoffrey Chaucer, but I do have a couple of small volumes, more like pamphlets than books. . .“ and never being one to pass up a chance to sell a book I added,  “If you would like one send me your name and address.  I’ll have one in the next mail.  They are $2.50 and $3.50 each.”  I kinda felt bad about that since I hate salesmen, but I seem to be the only one willing to sell my books on my behalf so I swallow my distaste and sell, sell, sell.</p><p>        Next day Cassandra was back.  “Please send both books.”  She gave an East Coast address.  A little terse, I thought, but hey, a sale is a sale.  I put the books and an invoice in an envelope and sent them, figuring that was the last I would hear of Cassandra.</p><p>        Days passed.  I forgot about gypsies and strange e-mails and went on about my life.  Cassandra fell out of my mind, bumped by other troubles, until I opened my e mail one day and found her waiting for me.  My heart skipped when I saw the address and I called myself an idiot as I was opening the message.</p><p>        “You break my heart with the depth and breadth of the pain in your poetry,” it said.  “Even the comic and wry pieces are tears solidified into verse.  I was angry with you when you came on with your sales pitch, but now I understand.  I’ll have the money to you in a couple of days.  Shrinks say that paying for the sessions has a lot to do with the healing; in this case I think the being paid has the healing power.”</p><p>        I sat there with my mouth open and tears running down my chin.  I read the message three more times to make sure I was really seeing what I thought I was seeing.  This woman really got me.  She understood, or seemed to.  The woman I had been married to for thirty years didn’t get me.  I had long since given up trying to make her understand, contenting myself with the peace of domestic quietude and writing fuck stories under a pseudonym to release my sexual frustration.  But this other woman . . .</p><p>        “I am awe-struck!”  I wrote back to Cassandra.  “Other people have told me they liked my poetry, but none ever made me cry doing it.  Forget the money.  I owe you more than I can pay.  I wish you were here so I could kiss you.”</p><p>        The little Instant Message box popped up and I read, “I’ll collect that kiss next week.  I have to be in Phoenix for a meeting.  What’s your phone number?”</p><p>        My heart was pounding.  What the hell was going on here?  Mind tape began turning behind my eyes and I saw my long legged blond again, but I discarded the fantasy as fast as I could.  I considered coming right out and asking, “How old are you and what do you look like?”  but I just couldn’t bring myself to do it.  A woman that got me like that could be seventy and rotund and it wouldn’t matter a bit.  I sent my home phone number but added, “ You may have trouble getting me there though.  I’m a security guard/writer and I work Dracula’s hours.  Maybe you’d do better to call me at work.”  I gave her the number of the work cell phone.  “I look forward to actually meeting you.”</p><p>        “You may change your mind when you see me,” her IM came back.</p><p>        Uh oh, I thought.  Sounds like she’s a troll and knows it, but what the hell, you ain’t exactly Adonis yourself.  And then I thought why didn’t you tell her you were married, Geoff?</p><p>        “Your life is about to change…” the kid had said.  Maybe he was right, and maybe for the better.</p><p>About a dozen times in the next few days I thought, What the hell do you think you’re doing?  Nevertheless, I waited with no patience at all for a phone call.  The cell phone I carry at work almost never rings and when it finally did I almost had a heart attack.  I fumbled it open and said “Hello.”</p><p>“Hello Mr. Chaucer, this is Cassandra.”</p><p>“Cassandra?” Nice voice!  In the alto range and smooth as silk.</p><p>“I’m here in Phoenix.”</p><p>“You are?  I mean, Uh, great!  Uh…”</p><p>“I’m at the Saddle Back Inn,” she went on.  “Would you like to have breakfast with me in the morning?”</p><p>I nearly dropped the phone and when I tried to speak my voice wouldn’t work, but I finally managed to say, “Sure.  Where?”</p><p>“Just meet me in the lobby of the hotel and we’ll decide?  Is that OK?”</p><p>“Perfect.  Great.  I’ll see you about nine or so.”</p><p>“OK, see you in the morning,” she said cheerfully and hung up before I could say, “How will I know you?”  or anything.</p><p>A few minutes after nine I walked into the Lobby of the Saddle Back Inn still in my rent-a-cop uniform.  I figured maybe it would help her recognize me since I had not the foggiest idea what to look for in her.  The place wasn’t crowded.  From the door I could see three or four people none of whom fit either my spherical troll or fantasy girl ideas so I walked into the lobby to look around some more; and then she was there beside me.  I don’t know where she came from, but she was suddenly there and my mouth fell open.  She was neither troll nor five foot ten, long-legged blond.  She was a drop-dead gorgeous red head, smiling with a full lipped mouthful of perfect white teeth, and her green eyes were almost on the same level as mine. I’m six – six.  She was wearing a dark blue linen suit with a froth of cream colored blouse showing between the lapels and low heeled dark blue “fuck me” pumps that matched the purse hung over her shoulder.</p><p>“Are you Geoff?”  She asked.</p><p>I blinked at her a couple of times and closed my mouth.  The idea of a six foot three or four-inch woman had a hard time getting through my cognitive screens, and when it did my cynical nature started looking for five o’clock shadow.  All my eyes found were lovely peach soft cheeks.  “You can’t be Cassandra!”  I said.</p><p>Her smile disappeared.</p><p>“That didn’t come out right,” I hurried to say.  “I mean yes I’m Geoff, and you are probably the most beautiful woman I ever clapped eyes on.”</p><p>Her smile returned, aided in its charm by a slight blush, and she put out her hand.  “Thank you,” she said.</p><p>I took the offered hand and found it soft and warm but strong, and that is when her perfume wafted over me.  I’m no connoisseur of fragrance, but it had the aroma of honeysuckle as its base and it had two effects on me.  My knees wobbled and my jockey shorts got tight.</p><p>“I was afraid you’d be disappointed,” she said.</p><p>“Disappoi. . .How in hell could you even consider that possible?”</p><p>She blushed again. “Well I usually tower over the men I meet and they seem to be— I don’t know— intimidated.”</p><p>“I guess I understand.”</p><p>She smiled. “Can I have my kiss now?”</p><p>“Huh?”  I’m just so quick witted and facile it is almost embarrassing.</p><p>“You said you would pay me for your poetry with a kiss.  I said I was coming to collect.”</p><p>I blinked at her several times and finally said, “I think we better go get breakfast.  I need to sit down.”</p><p>We ended up seated at a table in a coffee shop down the block.  She was sitting across from me making it difficult to concentrate, but I made a valiant try at it.</p><p>“So have you decided if you are a writer or not?” I asked.</p><p>She turned on that heart-stopping smile again.  “Yes.  I’ve decided not.  After I read your poetry I decided I didn’t need the heart ache.”</p><p>I had to laugh at that.  My whole life has been words on paper with lots of heartache to butter the stories, but I wouldn’t have traded it for happiness.  “Not only are you a beautiful lady you are a smart one.  I’ve always said I was too damn dumb to quit and I wouldn’t want anyone else to be in that position.”</p><p>“I admire that,” she said.  “I admire it and I would like to know the man better.”  She ran those green eyes over me and I could feel the heat of them when they locked with mine.  It was like touching a live wire.  “And I still want my kiss,” she added.</p><p>I swallowed hard and thought, If you don’t go for this now you will hate yourself for the rest of your life!  “You want it here—now?”  I said, trying to be all urbane and Playboy sophisticated.</p><p>About then the waitress got around to us, but after she’d asked her questions Cassandra looked at me with one eyebrow lifted quizzically.  “I don’t have much appetite.  How about you?”</p><p>I wasted no time in telling the waitress “I think we’ll wait until later.  Thanks anyhow.”  I stood up, dropped a dollar bill on the table and attended Cassandra as she stood.</p><p>Back in the lobby of the Saddleback I had a small attack of conscience and took her by the arm.  “Cassandra, I need to tell you something.”</p><p>She stopped and turned.  She was very close and her perfume was about to make me have a waking wet dream, but I still managed to say,  “I’m married.”</p><p>She put her hands on my arms, leaned in and offered her mouth.  “I don’t care,” she whispered and brushed her lips against mine.</p><p>That was all it took.</p><br><br><p>I don’t want you to think I was anxious but my clothes were off without a moment’s hesitation. Cassandra smiled when she saw my condition.  She wasn’t undressed, but had taken off her jacket.  Her nipples poked against her blouse like little fingers.  She sat down on the foot of the bed and ran her eyes over me, stopping meaningfully at my straining manhood.  Without taking her eyes from it she beckoned me closer with a crooked a finger.  When I was close enough she reached up and caressed my erection.  “Very pretty,” she said, then leaned forward and ran her tongue around the head.</p><p>“I don’t usually have a problem with premature ejaculation,” I began, “But if you keep that up I can’t make any promises.”</p><p>She laughed softly.  It was a dark velvet sound from deep in her throat and she increased the speed of her circling tongue.</p><p>“Oh God,” I said.  “Oh Gawd!”</p><p>That velvet laugh again and she moved forward to engulf my raging erection with her satin mouth.  She was a felatrix of surpassing skill.  Two or three bobs of her head and I began seeing clouds and stars and sunbursts all mixed together and a wave of celestial pleasure fountained up from my middle to wash over me.  I hadn’t cum like that since… I had never come like that.  It was like she was sucking out every drop of pleasure that had been hiding in all the corners of my body since I found out there was a difference between boys and girls.  My knees turned to water and I would have collapsed except that Cassandra brought her hands up behind me to squeeze my ass cheeks and steady me.</p><p>At last, regrettably, the fireworks quit going off in my groin and brain and she released me.  I turned and sat down on the bed beside her but I was still so shaky I had to lay back. I closed my eyes.</p><p>“Was that good?” She asked mischievously.</p><p>“Sweet thing, you have no idea how good that was, or how much I needed it.”</p><p>“Actually I do,” she said.  “The boss said you were dreadfully in need of a blow job.”</p><p>I opened my eyes and frowned.  “Boss?  What boss?”</p><p>She smiled but this time it had something of the grinning cobra in it, and the little laugh that followed had no more velvet in it.  “The boss.  He sent me to offer you a proposition.”</p><p>All of a sudden my balls began to pull up tight and I involuntarily looked at my left palm.  I knew who the boss was and it made a prickling jolt run from my crotch to my scalp.  I sat up. “What’s the proposition?  He want my soul?”</p><p>“That’s what he always wants.”</p><p>“We are talking about—“</p><p>“Lucifer, Old Nick, Satan—right.”</p><p>“OK, what is this?  Who really put you up to this, I want to thank ‘em.  You give a hell of a blow job!”</p><p>“Glad you enjoyed it, and I promise you I am not kidding.  I really am an agent of the Dark Master, and He wants to make a deal with you.”</p><p>The top of my mind thought she was kidding, but deeper down in the ancient, reptilian part of my brain there was a whisper of fear.  She wasn’t kidding.</p><p>“If you think I’m gonna sell out for a blow job, you are out of your demon mind!  My fuckin’ sex life is miserable, what little of it there is, but not enough for that kind of a trade.”</p><p>“Chaucer, don’t be an idiot.  The blowjob was just an earnest, to show you that the boss can deliver quality.  No, the proposition is something a little bigger than that.”</p><p>“OK, I still think this is a joke, but I’ll play.  What am I gonna get in return for my immortal soul?  Money?  Fame?  Power?”</p><p>“Eighteen months in the number one position on the New York Times best seller list.”</p><p>My mouth fell open and there didn’t seem to be enough air in the room.  If there was ever a temptation that would suck me in like a black hole sucks in light that was it.  I had spent thirty years trying to sell a book to a big enough company to give me just that chance.  I had written five books, all of which drew nothing but scorn from every publisher I had ever offered them too.  I had published poetry and a few stories in bigger publications, but the only books I had on the market was a novel I had published myself and the poetry chap-books I was peddling on the internet.  The other four novel manuscripts were even now out collecting yet more rejection from yet more publishers; and here this gorgeous creature was telling me Satan would swap what I wanted more than I wanted my next breath for something I wasn’t even sure I had.</p><p>“So, what then?  I sign a contract in blood and Random House buys one of my manuscripts, and hell gets me when I die?”</p><p>“More or less, but you’re thinking too small.  All your manuscripts are going to be bought by Time-Warner, and they are all going to go to the top of the list.  Sell millions of copies in translation to every language on earth.”</p><p>“Time-Warner?  I didn’t even submit to them.  You gotta have an agent to get past the door dragon there and you gotta have a best seller to get an agent.”</p><p>“Not when the boss owns the place and the people that run it.”</p><p>“Shit!  I should have known, with some of the crap they put out.  OK, is that it?  Where’s the contract?”</p><p>“In the interest of full disclosure, I have to tell you one more thing.”</p><p>I knew it! I thought.  It has been a joke from the get-go and now Ashton Kutcher or somebody pops out and tells me I been punked.</p><p>“OK, what’s the rub?”</p><p>She picked up her purse, opened it and took out a 38 snub-nosed pistol.  She put her finger through the trigger guard and let the blue-black hardware hang from it.  “You have to commit suicide.”</p><p>“What, now?”</p><p>Cassandra shrugged.</p><p>“I don’t think so.  I mean I may not be the brightest fella on the planet, and I have considered . . .but, no.  Not on the earnest of a blowjob and the weight of a contract that you say is authorized by the Satanic Majesty—which I have yet to see by the way.”</p><p>She pouted up that beautiful face, bowed her head and then looked at me from beneath her brows.  “You don’t trust me.”</p><p>I ran my eyes over that mouth-wateringly beautiful creature and said, “Much as I’d like to—no.”</p><p>She took a deep breath and put the gun back in her purse.  She stood and began unbuttoning her creamy white blouse to show me the wisp of bra beneath it and the luscious globes it covered.</p><p>I gathered all the spizzerinktum I could summon and said, “OK, hold it.  I would love you to go farther, and I’d love to . . . well—but even the greatest lay in the world is not gonna make me shoot myself on a promise.  I mean they call your boss the Prince of Lies.  I need something a little more concrete.”</p><p>Cassandra shrugged again.  “I told the boss you were going to be a tougher nut than he thought.  It shows in your poetry.”</p><p>Once more she had managed to throw a punch I hadn’t expected.  “You really did read the poetry?”</p><p>“Home work.  What is it gonna take?”</p><p>I thought a moment.  If this was for real—the thought didn’t seem as absurd to me as it looks here— but if it was for real could I do it?  Was it worth it?  How bad did I want to be a best-selling author?</p><p>“I’ll need to actually see the contract before I agree, and I’ll have to have some kind of an earnest besides your—“ I indicated her perfect breasts.  “Proof that the Prince of Lies will deliver before I sign.”</p><p>“Done!”  She said, smiling that heart-melting, ball-scorching smile, and was gone.  I found myself sitting alone and naked in the room.  Beside me on the bed was a piece of parchment the size of an old style handbill with the ugly hunk of blue-black steel sitting on it like a paperweight.</p><p>I stood up and got dressed not touching the gun or the parchment and headed for the door thinking, interesting, but too weird!  I got a blowjob out of it, so let’s call it a win and get the hell out of here!</p><p>The doorknob wouldn’t turn.  I tried to twist it with both hands, and checked the lock, and pulled at it with all my might but the door would not budge.  Then the knob began heating up under my hands and I let go and backed up.</p><p>“Forget something Geoff?”</p><p>Her voice scared the shit out of me and I whirled around.  There was Cassandra looking as desirable as a few moments before, standing at the foot of the bed beside the parchment and the 38.  She picked them up and extended them toward me.</p><p>“I haven’t signed it,” I said.  “I think maybe I changed my mind.”</p><p>She shook her head with patient disgust.  “Geoff, do you really think you will ever get anywhere without the boss’ help?  Do you really think you are that talented?  Sorry boy, t’ain’t so.  You got a grain or two of aptitude but there’s a million others out there that just blow you away—“ she chuckled.  “—No pun intended.  And out of those million talented scribblers how many do you think die as frustrated unknowns?”</p><p>        I answered with a shake of my head.</p><p>        “99.99%,” she said. “And the hundredth of a percent who ever make it usually die young because they can’t take the heat of fame.”</p><p>        “But—there are others.  That live long lives and—”</p><p>        “And what?  They still wind up dead at the end don’t they?  Look at it this way, you’ll be getting everything they have and saving yourself another fifty years of pain.”</p><p>        “But…” and that was all I had.  But…  There wasn’t anything to follow it.  She was probably right on all counts and I would die a bitter frustrated unknown without some kind of help.  And sure as shit the other power of the universe wasn’t taking my phone calls so there was no “But…”</p><p>        Still—Eternal Hell.</p><p>“I’ll take the contract…and the gun, but I gotta think about this some more.  Besides, you said your boss would give me some kind of proof that this isn’t just a trick.”</p><p>        She extended the parchment and the 38 and smiled again.  I took them.</p><p>“Clever boy,” she said.  “As I said before, you will be contacted.”  And once more she was gone.</p><br><br><p>I didn’t get too much sleep over the next couple of days.  Not that I ever do.  This midnight to eight shift and trying to sleep in the daytime is a bitch at the best of times.  Don’t know how Dracula managed.  What I did do was sit looking at that parchment and that 38.  I took it to work with me and laid it on the desk of the guard post right next to the laptop I write on between rounds.  I read every word of the contract.  It was so straightforward and mundane it was almost laughable except that it was just like Cassandra had said:</p><p>“The party of the first part, his Satanic Majesty, Mephistopheles, Lucifer, Ruler of Hell and all the neither regions, herein after called the Devil, promises that, in return for the soul of the party of the second part, Geoffrey Chaucer, the Devil will cause to be published all the writings of the aforementioned Geoffrey Chaucer.  The Devil furthermore promises to make each book he causes to be published a best seller, which will rise to the number one position on the New York Times best seller list and remain at that position for a minimum of eighteen months.  In exchange for these considerations the Devil will claim the soul of the aforementioned Geoffrey Chaucer at the instant of the said Geoffrey Chaucer’s decease. . .”</p><p>And on and on.  At the bottom Old Nick had already signed his full name in a beautiful Spenserian script with swoops and curlicues.  There was a line for my signature with the printed notice beneath it saying that the signature must be in the blood of the party of the second part, Geoffrey Chaucer.</p><p>It all seemed pretty straightforward and ironclad.  All I needed was the demonstration of satanic power and intention.  But it didn’t come.  Apparently Old Nick was letting me stew and while I was stewing he, or someone, made sure I had more reason to give in.  Before the whole contretemps with Cassandra I had sent out a dozen proposals to publishing houses.  The day after I received Lucifer’s contract I got all of them back.  I was used to rejection but it usually trickled in one “fuck off “ letter at a time.  In the two days after Cassandra all my proposals got rejected and landed in my mailbox with such a thud of failure that the poor box groaned beneath the beating.  And so did I.  That 38 was beginning to look like a comfortable solution even without the Devil’s deal.  I am obviously already in hell, I thought, so I might as well get out of this one and on to the next one, but I didn’t do it.  Instead I dithered and waited.  On the third day I got an official looking letter from TIME-WARNER BOOKS.  I didn’t wait to get home with it.  I tore it open standing on the sidewalk in front of my mailbox.</p><p>“Dear Mr. Chaucer,</p><p>“Your agent, Ms Cassandra Devilin, presented a proposal for publication of your book SERPENTS AND DOVES, and we have decided to publish it.  Ordinarily we would have simply allowed your agent to tell you this news, but she informed us that a direct notification from us would honor an agreement she and her agency had made with you, hence this notice.  It was a little out of the ordinary but with a manuscript so aglow with  potential as SERPENTS AND DOVES we decided it was not too much to ask.</p><p>You agent has received an advance check for $100,000.00 against future sales and will contact you with a copy of the publishing contract.  Please sign said contract in the presence of a notary public.</p><p>Again, welcome to the TIME-WARNER publishing family.  We look forward to a long and lucrative relationship.</p><p>                                Sincerely</p><p>                                    Nicholas Oldman, “Editor-in-chief”</p><p>I read through it a half dozen times from letterhead to signature still standing by the mailbox and said, “Holy Shit!”</p><p>I walked to the house in a daze, went into my office and flopped down at the desk.  I took the 38 out of the pocket of my jacket and laid it before me.  You still don’t really know, a little voice in the back of my mind whispered, but I knew it was for real—</p><p>contract, publisher, and pistol.</p><p>The phone rang.  It was Cassandra.  “Meet me in the coffee shop where we went the other day.  I have something for you.”</p><br><br><p>She was sitting in the same booth we had sat in before and, as heart-stoppingly beautiful as she had been the first time, she was even more so this time.  She wore a deep green sleeveless dress with a turn-up-able collar and buttons down the front that screamed to be unbuttoned.  The light gleamed off her red hair and flashed off her smile like something out of a cartoon and the look had the same effect on me as the last time.  I had to hurry to slide into the booth before some old lady saw the tent-pole in my pants and called a cop.</p><p>“Glad to see me, are you, Geoff?”   She kicked off her shoe and stretched out her bare foot to run her toes up the bottom of my pants leg.</p><p>At that moment I would have taken the 38 out of my pocket and shot myself so long as I could have another ten minutes in a hotel room with her first.</p><p>Reading my mind she said, “Later Geoff, I promise.  Business first.”  She opened the purse that lay on the table and brought out a plain white #10 envelope, which she handed me.  The check inside was from TIME-WARNER and was drawn on the Bank of America.  I had never seen that many zeros gathered behind a one in all my life.</p><p>“Notice that it is for the whole amount.  I might be your ‘agent,’ but I don’t need the fee.”  She laughed that low velvety laugh.  “What say we go cash that and spend it?  I don’t need the fee, but I like room service… after.”</p><br><br><p>Cassandra and I went back to the Saddleback and fucked like bunnies for hours until I was drained, then we ordered Chateau Briand and Dom Perignon. It was perfect.  Perfect!  It was what I had always wanted; an incredibly beautiful, sexual woman whose concentration was unbreakably on me followed by delicious viands.  Everything the physical body could possibly want, but something still nagged at the back of my mind.  Years of getting shit on tend to make a fella somewhat mistrustful.</p><p>“Why me, Cassandra?” I asked around a mouthful of goffret potatoes.</p><p>“Why not you?”</p><p>“It just seems like an awful lot of trouble for Lucifer to go to just to get my soul.”</p><p>“Oh that.  It wasn’t for your soul.  He already had your soul.  Got it the second you decided that you were going to be a writer.  You’ve been in hell since the first day you, in your arrogance, set pen to paper thinking you could create something that others would care to read.  He’s got the soul of every artist on earth.  It’s the way the universe is built.  The big guy—”</p><p>“Big guy? ”</p><p>She gestured with her fork toward the ceiling. “The other one.”</p><p>“Ah, that one.”</p><p>“Yeah. He built the universe so that artists have a tough time.  He’s jealous, ya know, so my boss gets all of you without even a quibble.”</p><p>I blinked at her.  “Then what was all this about?  With the contract and the gun and all of that?”</p><p>She laughed.  “Just the Boss messin’ with you.  He likes that.  Makes the torture more interesting if he changes it up every now and then.”</p><p>“But—Yeah, but—If this is already hell—I’m confused.  Do I sign the contract or not?”</p><p>“Naw.  No need, unless you still want your books to get published—best sellers and like that.”</p><p>I’m sure my mouth fell open.  “Of course I want …wait a minute.  If I don’t sign and shoot myself and all that, I’m right back where I started?”</p><p>Cassandra’s face took on a mocking smile.  “Not exactly.  See your wife’s best friend saw us go into this coffee shop and, nosy bitch that she is, she followed us.  Even as we speak she is on her way to tell Michele that you are up here fucking the brains out of a gorgeous red head.  Your marriage, such as it was, is over.  All the money that is going to come from this first book, she’s gonna get most of it, and your lawyers are gonna get the rest.”</p><p>“And if I sign?”</p><p>“Same thing only multiplied by five.  Shooting yourself is absolutely going to be your best solution.  You better sign and get on with it.”</p><p>Suddenly the remains of our meal were gone and the parchment contract was lying before me with the 38 on it like a paperweight.  Beside it was an old-fashioned dip point pen and an exacto-knife</p><p>I looked across the table at the beautiful, smiling Cassandra then looked at my left palm.  Long and miserable the one lifeline, short and miserable the line from the junction on.  I picked up the exacto-knife, jabbed it into my wrist and when the blood was flowing I dipped the pen point into it and signed.</p><p>“How soon do I have to finish the job?”</p><p>“Any time.  Like I said, the boss has had you forever so he’s in no hurry.  Hang around as long as you like; as long as you can stand it.”</p><p>“And you?  Are you gonna hang around too?”  I asked, but I already knew the answer.</p><p>“Sorry.  On to the next assignment.  You wouldn’t want me to hang around anyway, not when you find out what I really am?”</p><p>“What you really are?”</p><p>She reached across the table, caressed my cheek, and smiled her dazzling smile, then right before my eyes Cassandra became the gypsy kid from the bar.  I jerked back from his touch and he laughed, but before the laugh was finished he turned into a horned demon, scaled above the waist and covered with rank hair below.  Between the legs was an erect penis that resembled a barbed harpoon and from the serpent-like mouth hung a forked tongue.  “Let’s play now, Geoff,” it hissed and sprang toward me with a deep laugh but disappeared before it touched me.</p><br><br><p>So that’s my story.  Believe it, don’t believe it.  Fuck you.  I don’t care.  My second book just started up the best seller list and everything the Cassandra demon promised has happened.  I’m divorced, my kids won’t speak to me, and I have less money now than before I signed.  Lawyers are coming at me from every direction.  Reviewers have all excoriated SERPENTS AND DOVES as unreadable crap and are doing the same to THE JEWEL WITHIN THE FLAME. The books keep selling but I know now that they are crap.  Turns out the editors that rejected all my manuscripts were right all along.  I am a no talent hack that has made it strictly because I made a deal with the devil, and now I sit here at my desk with the 38 lying beside this computer.  I’ve finished this, probably the longest suicide note in history, and the only thing left is to finish the job, so –out of this hell and on to the next.</p><br><br><p>THE END</p>
