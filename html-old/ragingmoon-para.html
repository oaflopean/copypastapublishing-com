<p>﻿A brilliant supermoon blazed low in the clear night sky above a quiet suburban neighborhood. All the details on its glowing smudged surface, such as the ghostly pale face streaked with long streaming sprays of white and splattered with irregular splotches of grey and spotted with far-flung speckles of a whiter white, were starkly illuminated for the multitude of eyes drawn up to it like the tides. </p><p>Far below this commanding heavenly body an oft-wrecked twelve-year-old sedan drove erratically down a side street in a residential neighborhood teetering on the lower edge of middle-class. Vivian, its erratic driver, was oblivious to the splendor in the sky above. Early thirties, rough around the edges yet sharp-skinned, she was oblivious to most everything. The jeans and tee shirt and cheap tennis shoes she wore were nothing to take note of. What should be noted was that her entire being screamed tension and worry without making a sound. It's been a hard life, and it's getting harder. The object of her blinder-eyed focus was her twelve-year-old son Kody seated beside her. It's been hard on him, too. “Who started it?” Kody looked out the window, rigidly ignoring his mother. “Your butt is grounded. For a month. If you don't talk to me. Right now.\"</p><p>A jogger running in their same direction materialized in the headlights. Even in the searchlight candlepower of the supermoon Vivian, distracted by her anger, nearly ran him over. She screamed as she swerved to just miss him. Slamming on the breaks and stopping several yards beyond, she leaned out the window to yell back as he approached. “I almost hit you, you moron!” The jogger ran up and planted a hand on her forehead, shoving her head back in through the open window. Then he ran on past, hardly breaking stride. Furious, Vivian shifted into neutral and revved her motor, like she was going to run him down. The jogger, unconcerned, extended his right middle finger back at her without even looking as he ran on.</p><p>“Mom. Don't act stupid.”</p><p>“Did you see what he did? He pushed me.”</p><p>“You were yelling at him.” </p><p>Vivian shifted into gear and floored it. Hearing her coming, the jogger ran off the road up into a front yard. Vivian blasted her horn as she roared past him. </p><p>Kody was mortally embarrassed. “Mom. Stop it.” He turned around to look out the rear window. The jogger loped back onto the street as they drove away, fading into the black in even this dazzling light.</p><p>Vivian rubbed her face, hard, ran her fingers through her now-wild hair, desperately trying to calm down, as she slowed to somewhere near the speed limit. “I've got enough worries. Without worrying about some idiot jogger running at night down the middle of the road.”</p><p>Kody turned back around to catch his mother's manic reflection in the rearview mirror. \"He was on the side of the road. And it's really bright out. You should have seen him sooner.\" </p><p>Vivian glared at her son. “I didn't see him because all I could see was your smirking face. Why can't you behave yourself? For one night. Why can't you spend the night at your friend's house like normal kids your age do? Instead of beating him up? Huh? Why do I have to get a screaming call in the middle of the night from a hysterical mother to come get my homicidal son?” Vivian whipped the car into a driveway, skidding to a halt before the closed garage door.</p><p>“When are you getting the garage door opener fixed?”</p><p>“The garage door opener is the least of my worries.” Vivian flung open the car door and jumped out. Kody, embarrassed beyond endurance, sat glaring at his insane mother as she unlocked the garage door and raised it. Then he hopped out and dashed into the garage. “Your bag!”</p><p>“I got to use the bathroom!” Kody ran inside the house. Vivian walked back to the car and pulled it in, then cut the motor off and climbed out. Closing the car door, she tenderly touched her stomach. Then pulled up her tee shirt and looked. No hourglass waist. Vivian released her tee shirt and went around to the back of the car, where she stumbled over a ball bat leaning against the wall. “Damn it, Kody!” She scowled as she looked all around the cramped barely-one-car garage. Besides the baseball bat now laying in the open doorway, a bike was leaned up against the other wall and an unpacked camping gear lay scattered all across the back of the garage. “You’re going to clean up this mess! Tonight! Do you hear me?” Vivian opened the trunk and reached in for a bulging backpack.</p><p>Tires squealed. A soft thud. A cry of pain. Vivian looked out to the street. A car was stopped at the end of her driveway. In its headlights a body lay on the street before it, raising up, trying to get up. The engine roared and the car ran over the body. Thump thump. All four wheels. Like a speed bump. Then raced away. “Shit.”  </p><p>Vivian ran out to the end of her driveway. The jogger was sprawled in the middle of the street, writhing in agony and moaning. She nearly smiled. Until the jogger beseeched her with his pain-filled face. She kneeled before him. “Can you move?” The jogger just stared, moaning softly. Vivian looked up and down the street. “I can't leave you out here. You'll get run over. Again. You got to move.” </p><p>Vivian stood and grabbed an arm to drag him by. The jogger cried out in pain, but tried to scoot with his feet to help her. Vivian pulled him out of the street onto the end of her driveway. She tried to release him, but he clung to her arm with surprising strength. “Hey. Let go.” She broke free and backed away. Still, he reached for her. “I'm going in to call nine-one-one.” With a smirk, “Now don't run off.\" Vivian ran into the garage and on into the house. While the jogger wriggled slowly up the driveway toward the garage.</p><p>Vivian dashed in from the garage to the kitchen. The rooms of the house were small and badly cluttered, nearly as cramped as the garage. And no cleaner. “Kody!”</p><p>Kody emerged from the downstairs bathroom. “Will you stop screaming.”</p><p>Vivian snatched up the phone and punched nine-one-one. “You know that jogger I nearly ran over?  He just got run over. Right in front of our house.”</p><p>“Is he dead?” Kody started toward the garage.</p><p>“Don't go out there.” Kody opened the door to the garage. “Damn it, Kody!” Vivian dropped the phone and ran over to slam the door in his face. “We don't know who he is. Stay away from him.” Kody turned away angrily and ran into the living room up to the front window to look out. Vivian hurried back to pick up the phone.</p><p>“A cop's here,” Kody informed her.</p><p>“Already? Are you sure?”</p><p>“Mom. I know what a cop looks like.”</p><p>Into the phone, “There's been an accident. But the police are here already. So bye.” Vivian dropped the phone and raced to the door to the garage. “You stay in here.” Vivian hurried out to the garage, closing the door behind her. </p><p>The jogger was crawling up to the open garage door, all twisted up in pain but determined. “You crawled this far?\" Vivian asked. \"Bad as you're hurt? Why?” She started around the back of her car toward him. </p><p>A policeman walked up the driveway from his cruiser parked at the curb in front of the house. “Ma'am,” he called out. “Please stay back.”</p><p>Vivian froze, looking to the policeman. He was drawing his revolver as he approached. “Is he dangerous?”</p><p>“Yes. Now go back in your house.”</p><p>Vivian looked from the policeman to the jogger, confused. “He could have done a carjacking. Earlier tonight. He pushed my head. He could have grabbed it and yanked me out of my car and taken it. If he was trying to get away. But he didn't.”</p><p>The policeman kneeled beside the jogger, placing the barrel of his gun to his temple. He looked up at Vivian, his face distorted with fury. “Get inside! Now!” Vivian backed away in fright.  </p><p>While the policeman was distracted with Vivian, the jogger swung one arm up knocking the barrel away from his head. The policeman fired, the bullet blasting harmlessly into the concrete floor. The jogger swung up his other arm. Clenched in his fist was a metal tent stake. He buried it in the policeman's neck. The policeman jerked to his feet, dropping his gun and grabbing his neck, the tent stake deeply embedded in it as blood pulsed out. The jogger grabbed the baseball bat and swung hard. He connected with a knee. The policeman crashed to the pavement. Scooting up to the policeman thrashing about on the driveway, the jogger raised the bat high above his head and brought it smashing down into the policeman's upturned face.</p><p>Vivian, having witnessed all this in frozen horror, now, finally, screamed. The jogger, covered in blood and still clutching the bat, looked up at her. Vivian fled into the house.</p><p>Kody stood expectantly before her as she burst in. “What happened?”</p><p>Vivian slammed the door and locked it. “Go out the back door! Run to the O’Briens!” Vivian darted to the phone and punched nine-one-one. “There’s a madman out there! Go! Run!”  </p><p>Kody merely stared at her. “What about you?”</p><p>“I'm right behind you. After I call. Go!” Kody ran to the back door but didn't open it. “Run, damn it!”</p><p>“Not without you.”</p><p>Vivian glared angrily at him. Then turned her attention to the phone. “I called before? About an accident? Said the police had arrived? Well, the cop's down. I saw it. Officer down. But the madman's too hurt to get far.” After a pause, “Yeah, we're okay. For now. Me and my son. Got the address?” Another pause. “That’s it. Okay, we’re out of here.”  </p><p>Vivian jammed the phone into her back pocket and ran to the back door. Kody flung it open and ran out into the dark. Vivian started out, then dashed back into the kitchen. Kody stuck his head back in the door to see what had happened to her. Vivian opened a drawer and snatched up a huge butcher knife. She ran with it out the back door, shooing Kody before her.</p><p>The incredibly huge incredibly bright full moon lit up the night sky as Vivian and Kody fled across their backyard.</p><p>Later that night in the living room Vivian sat on the couch hugging Kody. She was extremely agitated, while he docilely allowed his mother to baby him. A distraught police officer paced before them. “How's the policeman?” Vivian asked.</p><p>“He's dead,” the police officer answered.  </p><p>Vivian looked away, shivering in revulsion and hugging Kody even tighter. “What a horrible way to die.” Vivian looked back. “Who is he? The killer?”</p><p>“A neighbor of yours. Jim Fields. Lives three streets away. Do you know him?”</p><p>“No. He wasn't a criminal? On the run?”</p><p>“No. Nothing on his record worse than traffic tickets.” The police officer studied her as his pacing slowed. “Why did you ask that?”</p><p>“The policeman knew he was dangerous. He drew his gun. He had it against the man's head.” The police officer stopped pacing to stare at her. “I didn't think that was normal procedure for helping a hit and run victim.”</p><p>“It's not normal arrest procedure, either.”</p><p>“He must have known something. Because he was right. The man was very dangerous. Even hurt as bad as he was.”</p><p>“We found him in the garage just outside the door to your house. With the police revolver. Passed out. He made it that far before losing consciousness.” The police officer took a step toward her, staring plaintively. “Why was he so determined to come after you?”</p><p>“I don’t know! I never saw him before tonight!”  </p><p>The police officer stepped back, holding up a calming hand. “He can't hurt you now, ma'am. He's at Central Hospital under police guard. In intensive care. He might not live.”</p><p>Vivian tried desperately to calm down, but failed. “I hope he doesn't. He's a monster.”</p><p>The police officer nodded in agreement. “There's a full moon out.”</p><p>The front door opened. Everyone turned to look as Newman walked cautiously in. He was in his late thirties, pot-bellied and balding, soft in physique and spirit. He froze nervously just inside the door, looking unsurely at the police officer. Then he glanced at Vivian. “You okay, Viv? You and Kody?”</p><p>”Yes! Man, am I glad to see you!” Vivian looked to the police officer. “My boyfriend, Newman Mansfield.”</p><p>The police officer nodded agreeably to Newman as he eased the door closed and practically tip-toed across the room to the couch. He sat gingerly on Vivian's other side, placing her in the middle of what quickly became a tight knot of desperately grasping arms. Vivian kissed Newman just as desperately.</p><p>Later that night Vivian still desperately kissed Newman. Only they were in her bedroom seated on the edge of her bed. Finally, Newman leaned away to peer into her face. “You're safe, Viv. Really. The police said the guy's gone into a coma. He's near death.”</p><p>“Not near enough.” Vivian looked away, shivering. “I'm throwing that tent away.  I'm never going camping again.”</p><p>Newman, speculatively, “The force it must have took to drive a tent stake into a man's neck like that. It wasn't sharp at all.”</p><p>“Stop it. Please.” Vivian grasped him desperately again. “I don't want to talk about it anymore. I don't want to think about it.”</p><p>“Okay. You need to settle down. This isn't good for you, to get this upset.”</p><p>“Damn, I need a drink. I need a fifth!”</p><p>“You know you can't.”</p><p>“Just one shot?”</p><p>“Vivian, they prosecute women for mistreating their unborn children.” Vivian nodded in resignation. She took Newman's hand and placed it underneath her tee shirt on her stomach. He frowned and quickly withdrew his hand, causing Vivian to scowl at him. Then he stood. “You need to get in bed.”</p><p>“Why? I'll never be able to sleep.”</p><p>“You need to try.”</p><p>“You're staying? The night? I don't want to be by myself tonight.”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“What about Paul?”</p><p>“I let him out just before I came over.”</p><p>Vivian smiled happily and jumped up, hugging him once again. “You're so good to me, Man. To me and Kody. And our baby.”</p><p>Newman patiently untangled himself from her embrace. “Of course I am. Now I want you to get in bed. Doctor's orders.”</p><p>“Only if the doctor joins me.”</p><p>Newman smiled, a pathetic sickly smile, as he sat on the edge of the bed to remove his shoes. Vivian sat beside him to do the same, happily kissing him on the cheek.</p><p>Later that night Vivian slept peacefully. The curtain was open, allowing bright light from the supermoon to illuminate the room. There was a soft noise. Vivian jerked awake. The other side of the bed was empty. She sat up in a panic, looking all about, the covers falling away to reveal she was sleeping in a tee shirt and panties. In a soft whisper, Newman said, “I'm here. Be quiet.”</p><p>Vivian located him standing by the closed bedroom door in his undershorts, stepping into his pants. In a loud whisper, Vivian asked, “What are you doing?”</p><p>“I heard something.” Vivian slid back down into the bed in terror, drawing the covers up to her chin. While Newman fastened his pants. “Don't worry. It's not the killer. He's in a coma. Or dead, by now.” Despite his words, his nervousness and fear were evident. He was trying to convince himself as much as Vivian.</p><p>“Then what is it?”</p><p>“Who knows. Could be Kody banging around.” Newman pulled a small handgun out of his pants pocket and released the safety.</p><p>“Don't shoot Kody!”</p><p>Newman sighed wearily, looking at Vivian with long lost patience. “Of course not. Now settle down. I'll be right back.”</p><p>“Be careful.” Newman nodded as he opened the door. “I love you!” Newman continued to nod as he walked out, closing the door behind him.</p><p>Vivian stared at the closed door. Total silence. Not even the sound of footsteps or squeak of floorboards from the carpeted upstairs hall. Vivian trembled beneath the covers. Unable to wait in bed any longer, she threw back the covers and hopped up. She paused to look out the window.  The floodlight high in the sky displayed the neighborhood in sharp silvery light and deep impenetrable shadows. Vivian hurried on to the closed door. She listened. Heard nothing. She slowly opened the door. The hallway was dark. The entire house was dark. And totally quiet. Vivian hurried back to the nightstand on her side of the bed to snatch up the large butcher knife she had grabbed earlier, then hurried back to the open bedroom door.  </p><p>Vivian crept out into the upstairs hall. She softly moved down to the next door, which was closed. She slowly opened it and looked in. Kody slept peacefully. She eased his bedroom door shut. Peered into the dark hall, listening intently. She could see or hear nothing. She crept down the hall. </p><p>At the top of the stairs she peered down. The downstairs was black, quiet.         Until she heard a bump, then another soft noise. “Newman?” She heard something else, like something got knocked over. Vivian stepped back, pressing back flat against the wall beside the stairs, the large butcher knife gripped tightly and raised, ready to slash and stab. Her face was rigid with fright as the rest of her trembled with fear. She heard other soft noises. Something was going on downstairs, in the dark. She stayed frozen like that. For. Interminable. Moments. Awaiting whatever came up the stairs, steeling herself for her own self-defense and the defense of her son.</p><p>A light came on downstairs. Vivian peeked around the edge of the staircase. Newman appeared at the bottom, gun in hand. She sighed with immense relief. “What's going on?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>“I heard something!”</p><p>“That was just me knocking around in the dark.”</p><p>“Why was the light out? We left it on.”</p><p>“Bulb burned out. I turned on another light.” Newman started ascending the stairs.</p><p>“What did you find?”</p><p>‘Nothing.”</p><p>“Then what did you hear?” Newman shrugged as he put the safety on and slipped the gun into his pants pocket. When he reached the top of the stairs Vivian stepped up to hug him. Newman jumped back, catching her arm. She looked questioningly at him. He slowly, carefully took the large butcher knife from her still-clenched right hand. She smiled as he laid it aside on a table in the hall. “Sorry. You're the last person I want to stab.”  </p><p>Newman turned back and hugged her tightly in a smothering embrace. Vivian kissed him and wrapped her arms around him in response. She giggled as he caressed her with great heat. “Man, did you ever wake up in a good mood.” She stopped giggling when Newman yanked her tee shirt up and off, tossing it to the floor. “Newman! Not out here. Kody might wake up.” Newman ignored her as he continued to grope and fondle. “Newman!” Vivian broke free, stumbling back several steps. She smiled hesitantly, covering her bare breasts with her arms as she glanced to Kody's closed door. “Let's take it in the bedroom.” Newman, smiling lasciviously, nodded in agreement. Vivian stooped to snatch her tee shirt up from the floor. As she turned back toward her room, Newman slapped her soundly on the butt. “Oww!  Newman!” Vivian looked over her shoulder as she hurried ahead of him, before he had a chance to hit her again. “What's come over you?” Newman grinned even more lustily as he chased her into the bedroom.</p><p>Vivian dropped her tee shirt and jumped into bed, wriggling beneath the covers. Newman stopped at the side of the bed to yank his pants off. They gazed eagerly at each other, their eyes filled with desire. “I wish you'd felt like this earlier,\" Vivian said. \"I'd've got a lot more sleep.” Newman yanked off his undershorts, then leaped into bed beside her. While Vivian watched him with eyes wide with surprise. “What's got into you? You never strip off naked in front of me. You're so shy.” </p><p>Newman jerked the covers off Vivian and threw them aside. Smiling eagerly, Vivian opened her arms and legs to him. Newman fell heavily on top of her and ripped her panties off. “Man! I liked those!” Newman kissed her all over, pawed her all over. Vivian responded lustily, wrapping her arms and legs around him. Until he hurt her. “Oww. Man! Be gentle. The baby.”</p><p>With mocking voice, Newman said, “Man, Man, Man.” Then, hoarsely, “Newman's not here anymore.” Newman drove into her, thrusting so hard he knocked Vivian up against the headboard.  </p><p>Vivian grunted, momentarily stunned by the force of his entry. But the pain quickly meshed with rapidly mounting pleasure. She laughed with pure animal sensuality. “Man, you've never been more here.” Vivian panted hard and fast as the bed rocked, as Newman drove her up against the headboard again and again, as she bucked up trying to match his powerful movements. Huskily, “You haven't felt this big. This powerful. For a long time. Not since...” Vivian's voice trailed off, her train of thought derailed by her quickly mounting desire. </p><p>“That's because Newman's gone.”</p><p>“Ohh, Man, you are so gone.”</p><p>Newman raised up above Vivian, while still deep inside her, while still slamming into her. As he gazed down on her his visage transformed. His familiar flaccid face knotted into a fierce grimace. His twisted mouth drooled a thick stream of saliva down onto her. His eyes flashed with the bright light of the full moon flooding the room. When Vivian, wildly lost in her lovemaking, gazed up at him as she writhed beneath him her ecstatic face began to go lax, then to tighten in worry, then fear. What had happened to Newman? But Vivian was too far gone. She was on the edge and couldn't pull back. She thrust desperately up at Newman as he pounded her, her face now equally filled with sexual desire and mortal fear. </p><p>Newman's face continued to change. It grew darker, viler. He lowered his head to within inches of her terror-filled face. A long thick tongue shot out from between deadly knife-sharp teeth to flick across her face. Still, even yet, Vivian couldn't help herself, still her out-of-control body fought for the overwhelming orgasm that was building inside her. Newman lowered his head to her heaving breasts, the long tongue licking them. Still, Vivian clutched at him, desperately working her body up against him.  </p><p>Newman seized her throat with fingernails grown into long sharp claws. He spoke with a deep raw voice. “Enjoy it, bitch. This is the last fuck of your life.”</p><p>Despite her terror, Vivian did enjoy it. Her entire body began to tremble and quake with an onrushing orgasm unlike anything she had ever experienced. Newman dug into her throat, drawing blood, preparing to rip it open as she climaxed.  </p><p>The butcher knife slashed across Newman's throat. He went rigid with surprise and pain. Vivian, realizing only that Newman had stopped, threw her body up against him even harder. She whimpered, still grinding up against him. Until she was sprayed with his blood. Which hit her like a cold shower. Blood spurted down from the sliced-open throat across her sweating heaving body. The claws at her throat relaxed, lost their grip on her life. Finally, she screamed. Newman withdrew from inside of her as he tumbled off.  </p><p>To reveal Kody, in his pajamas, at the foot of the bed, butcher knife in his hand dripping blood. He looked down coldly at Vivian. “Get up.”</p><p>Vivian, still screaming, thrashed insanely with the blood-splattered covers to get beneath them. She stared with horror as her son leaned over Newman's still body and plunged the knife into his chest. Vivian screamed again,  “What are you doing?!”</p><p>“I need the heart.” Kody plunged the knife in again and again, hacking open Newman's chest.</p><p>“Stop it!” Kody ignored her, concentrating on the bloody task at hand.</p><p>Vivian stared, horrified, unable to even breathe, or look away. Until Kody reached in and pulled out the bloody heart. Vivian screamed, screamed, screamed! Kody squeezed the heart until it burst. Thick yellowish-greenish slime sprayed all about, covering him and Vivian. She screamed insanely, completely hysterical.  </p><p>Kody briefly inspected the burst heart. Then he tossed it aside, looking coolly to Vivian. “He's dead.”</p><p>“Of course he’s dead you cut his throat you cut his heart out of course he’s dead.”</p><p>“Get up. We've got to leave.” Vivian remained rigid beneath the gory bloody sheets, staring with terror at her son, who was still holding the knife. When he moved toward her across the bed she started screaming again. Kody lunged up to slap her. “Stop it. We've got to go.”  </p><p>Vivian stopped screaming, began to whimper as she recoiled in terror from her son. “Why? Why did you kill Newman?”</p><p>“He was going to kill you.” Vivian gently touched her throat, felt the claw marks, the blood, remembering. “We have to leave. Now.” Kody yanked the blood-soaked sheets off her.  </p><p>Vivian balled herself up, trying to conceal herself with her arms and legs. “Kody! I'm your mother!”</p><p>“No, you're not.” Kody climbed off the bed and walked across the room. Vivian unballed herself as soon as his back was turned to yank the covers back up. Kody picked up Newman's pants and took the gun out of the pocket. “There's more coming. Like him.” Kody motioned to Newman's body. “Do you want to be here when they arrive?” Vivian looked fearfully from Newman's body to Kody's steady piercing eyes. Until he turned away. “I'll give you one minute. Then I'm coming back to drag you out naked if I have to.” Kody walked out to the hall.</p><p>A minute later the bedroom door banged open and Kody walked in, dressed in jeans and tee shirt and sneakers. He had washed off most of the blood and slime and gore. The butcher knife, wiped clean, was stuck in his belt, while the gun bulged in his pants pocket. Newman's bloody body lay sprawled across the bed, same as before. Vivian appeared in the doorway to the master bath, now wearing clean panties and bra. She was washing the blood and gore from her face and neck.  </p><p>“That's good enough. We're going.” Kody hurried over to grab her by the arm. He started to drag her across the room, but she dug in her heels and slung her arm free. Kody held both hands up, looking them over critically, then glanced down over the rest of his body. “Weak kid.”  </p><p>Vivian hurried over to her closet and grabbed a pair of jeans off a hanger. “What's going on, Kody?”</p><p>“I'm not Kody.”</p><p>“I get that by now. Who are you?”</p><p>“Your guardian angel.” Vivian glared at him in disbelief as she yanked the jeans on. “Who just saved you from the demon you were making love to.”</p><p>“I was making love to my boyfriend.”</p><p>“Do you really believe that was your boyfriend?”  </p><p>Vivian fell silent as she fumbled to fasten her pants, remembering. Kody rushed over to the closet and yanked the blouse off the first hanger he came to. He tossed it to her. “He was going to kill you. In mid-orgasm.”</p><p>Vivian caught the blouse. She stared in amazement at Kody as she slipped it on.  “You shouldn't talk like that. To your mother. About sex, like that. It's not right.”</p><p>“Your son wouldn’t be talking to you like this.” Kody pulled the gun out of his pocket and handed it to her. “You keep this. I've got the knife.” Vivian jammed the gun down into her pants. Kody picked up a pair of her shoes and hurried out to the hall with them. Vivian followed, snatching her purse off the dresser as she ran by. She paused for a solemn mournful look back at Newman's body. Then ran out.</p><p>Kody and Vivian, buttoning her blouse, rushed down the upstairs hall. “What's happened to you, Kody?”</p><p>“Kody is safe. Kody is sleeping. Kody won't remember any of this.” Kody and Vivian rushed down the stairs, Vivian finishing up with her blouse. They hurried into the living room. Vivian froze. In the middle of the floor lay a bloody lifeless naked female body, a blood-soaked nurse uniform in shreds all about her. “Who is that?!”</p><p>“A nurse from the hospital.”</p><p>“What happened to her?!”</p><p>“He surprised me.”</p><p>Vivian couldn't take her eyes off the body. “He? Kody, I know you’re young, but you know that’s not a he.” Drawing closer, she saw that the chest has been brutally ripped open. “You did this?”</p><p>Kody stopped in the doorway to the kitchen. “No.”</p><p>“Newman?”</p><p>“It wasn't Newman. Just his body. Come on.” Vivian carefully stepped around the butchered body of the dead nurse, gazing down at it all the while with revulsion. Kody grabbed her arm and drug her on. She didn't resist as he pulled her out of the room.</p><p>Kody led Vivian into the garage. “You drive. I'll open the door.” Kody handed her shoes to her.</p><p>“Of course I drive. You don’t drive.” Kody glared at her, like he had earlier when they were arguing in the evening before all the violence. Then he hurried around the car to the garage door. Vivian, recognizing the glare, grew even more confused. That glare had been one she had seen many times before on her son's face. Shaking off her confusion, she tossed the shoes into the back, took her car keys out of her purse, tossed her purse into the back and climbed in behind the wheel.</p><p>Kody unlocked the garage door and raised it. Before the door was knee-high a</p><p>snarling pit bull lunged in. It knocked Kody to the concrete. Clawing him up. Chewing him up. Kody wrestled with it, but the pit bull mauled him. </p><p>        Vivian leaped out from behind the wheel screaming. She ran around the front of the car. The pit bull ripped into Kody tooth and claw. He desperately tried to protect his vulnerable throat. Vivian yanked the gun from her jeans, aimed shakily. Then fired. The blast knocked the pit bull off Kody. It scrambled to get up. She fired again. And again. Again. At last, it collapsed.</p><p>Vivian dropped down to Kody. He was drenched in blood, looking more dead than alive. Vivian wailed. “Kody!” Kody whimpered, trying to talk. Vivian dropped an ear down to his mouth. “What?”  </p><p>Kody spoke, barely able to. “The heart. Get the heart.” Vivian recoiled in horror and disbelief. “You have to. It'll come back. If you don't.” Kody tried to pull the butcher knife from his waistband, weakly failed. He looked up at her with pain-filled eyes. “I can't. You've got to. Quick.” Vivian laid the gun aside and hesitantly pulled the knife from his pants. She turned to confront the pit bull. “Do it. Now.”</p><p>Vivian crouched before the pit bull. She cautiously touched the dog, to turn it over onto its back. The pit bull lunged snarling up at her. Vivian screamed, dropping the knife as she fell back on top of Kody. But the dog was mortally wounded, it could do no more. The pit bull collapsed. </p><p>In a panic, Vivian snatched the gun up and blasted the dog. Again and again. Until she emptied the chamber into its body. While Kody, pinned beneath her, reached up with a weak hand to grab her, trying to make her stop. As the empty gun clicked several times, Vivian finally calmed. She now realized Kody was tugging at her. She rolled off him, peering closely into his wretched bloody face. “What?”</p><p>“You wasted bullets.”</p><p>“It wasn't dead.”</p><p>“You should have. Finished it. With the knife. We need bullets.”</p><p>Vivian clambered up off Kody. “I'll get more. Newman's got more. He always brings plenty of ammo.”</p><p>“The heart first. Get the heart.”</p><p>Vivian froze, staring fearfully at the unmoving blasted carcass of the pit bull. Steeling herself for the ordeal, she nodded as she slipped the empty gun into her jeans. She retrieved the butcher knife, then crawled over Kody to the pit bull. She touched it. No reaction. She shook it. No reaction. She rolled it over. No reaction. Vivian looked back at Kody. He urged her on with his eyes. Taking a deep breath, she raised the knife high and plunged it into the dog's chest. Blood spurted everywhere, drenching Vivian. She screamed and, holding the knife with both hands, hacked and hacked at the dog's chest. Finally, she stopped. She hesitantly reached in, revulsion broadcasting from every pore of her body. She gave a mighty yank. And she had it. The heart. Vivian held it up, dripping blood and gore, for Kody to see.</p><p>“Squeeze it.”</p><p>Vivian nodded resolutely, steeling herself once again. She dropped the knife and took the heart in both hands. Squeezed. The heart burst, spraying vile slime all over her. Vivian screamed. Covered in blood and slime and gore, she hurled the gory mess down. It splattered on the concrete. Vivian whirled down to Kody, snatching his limp badly bleeding body up in her arms and hugging him, wailing.</p><p>“We've got. To go.”</p><p>Vivian nodded, releasing Kody to stand and throw open the passenger door. “I'll get you to a hospital.” Vivian stooped and easily lifted Kody up in her arms.</p><p>“The bullets. Get the bullets.”</p><p>Vivian gently set Kody down in the passenger seat, then slammed the door and stuffed the butcher knife back into her waistband. She ran from the garage back into the house, then dashed through the kitchen into the living room. Where she froze. The nurse's naked bloody body lay lifeless as before. Only her chest hadn't been torn open. It appeared undamaged. Slowly, carefully, Vivian kneeled beside her. Looked closely. Touched her chest. Her skin was unmarked. Shaking her head in bewilderment, Vivian fearfully withdrew and rushed away and up the stairs.</p><p>Vivian froze in her open bedroom doorway. Everything was as she had left it. Including Newman's pants on the floor by the bed. Vivian crossed to retrieve the ammo. She stuffed it into her pockets, then dropped the pants. But she couldn't leave. She couldn't help herself. She had to see. Vivian slowly inched across to the bed. With trembling hand, she reached out to Newman's lifeless bloody body. She touched his shoulder. No reaction. She tugged. His body didn't move. She pulled harder. Newman's limp naked body rolled over onto its back. Vivian jumped back. In the bright streaming moonlight his open eyes stared blankly up at her. But his monstrous face had reverted. This was Newman's face, Newman’s body, not that of some hideous nightmare. Vivian whimpered, recoiling. She could clearly see his chest. No damage, just like the nurse. Only the slit throat. </p><p>Vivian jumped back from the bed and turned to flee. At the doorway, she stopped and raced back into her closet. She yanked a clean blouse off the first hanger she came to, then ran out.</p><p>Vivian ran out of the house and raised the garage door the rest of the way up, then flung open the driver door and jumped in behind the wheel, tossing her clean blouse into the back seat. Kody sat slumped against the passenger door, eyes closed, bleeding badly, looking more dead than alive. Vivian lunged over to him, peering closely into his face as she shook him. “Kody! Kody!”</p><p>Kody opened his eyes. He appeared weaker than ever. “Go.”</p><p>Vivian nodded resolutely, releasing him to start the car and shift into reverse. She peeled out of the garage down the driveway into the street, not bothering to look behind her. She tore off down the street without bothering to close the garage door, either. “I'll get you to a hospital. Real quick.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“What the hell do you mean no!”</p><p>“That's where they'll. Expect us. To go. They'll be waiting.”</p><p>“You’re dying!”</p><p>“No I'm not. I've nearly stopped the bleeding. I don't think I'll go into shock.”</p><p>“What are you talking about?”</p><p>“I'm not Kody. You must realize that by now.”</p><p>“Then get the hell out of my son’s body and bring him back!”</p><p>“I can't. Now. He'd die. If not for me. I'm all that's keeping him alive.”</p><p>Vivian slammed on the brakes, skidding to the side of the road. The force threw Kody out of his seat and slammed him against the dash. Vivian screamed! “Kody! I'm sorry!” Vivian grabbed Kody and hugged him to her.</p><p>“That's no way to treat me. If you want your son to live.”</p><p>“Of course I want you to live! Him to live! I'm just so...I don't know!” Vivian hastily straightened Kody up in his seat, belted him in. “Why did you...whatever you did...to my son?”</p><p>“After Newman killed the nurse I had no choice. He was the closest person.”</p><p>Vivian raised back up, having secured Kody. “So where are we going?”</p><p>“Is there an all-night supermarket close?” Vivian sat back, nodding hopefully. “Get some antibiotics. Pain medicine. Bandages. That'll help.”</p><p>Vivian pulled away from the curb and did a wide U-turn, running off the road through a front yard. “No.”</p><p>Vivian pulled back onto the road. “No what?”</p><p>“We can't drive back past your house.”</p><p>Vivian stopped in the middle of the road. “Why not?”</p><p>“Other demons might be there by now. Looking for us.”  </p><p>Vivian did another wide U-turn, running off the road again through another front yard. “Are you really an angel? My guardian angel?”</p><p>“Yes. Now go. Go.”</p><p>Vivian drove on down the road, glancing at Kody worriedly. “Is my son going to live?”</p><p>“I'm trying my best. You'd be dead now. Both of you. If not for me.” Vivian mulled this over as she ran a stop sign pulling out of her subdivision onto a major highway. “Don't do that.”</p><p>“Oh, right, after everything that's happened, I'm supposed to worry about a traffic ticket?” Vivian sped, pedal to the floor.  </p><p>“A cop might pull you over.”</p><p>“I'd love to see a cop right now.”</p><p>“Remember the last one?”</p><p>“What do you know about that?”</p><p>“I was there. The jogger.” Vivian stared horrified at Kody. “That cop was going to shoot me. Then shoot you and your son.” Vivian continued to stare horrified, remembering. The car ran off the road, off the shoulder. Vivian fought to bring the car back onto the road. “Stop driving so wildly. Do you really want to see another cop?”</p><p>Vivian quickly slowed, looking all around for any sign of one. “Not one like the last one.”</p><p>“You'll never know. Until it's too late. Like with your boyfriend.”  </p><p>Vivian hit the brake, quickly slowing down to safely below the speed limit. She very carefully drove on. Kody settled back into his seat, closing his eyes. “How did that nurse get here?\" Vivian asked.</p><p>“Drove her car.”</p><p>“Why did that nurse come here?”</p><p>“The jogger was dying. At the hospital. She was the closest person.”</p><p>“So you jumped from the jogger to the nurse, then from the nurse to Kody.”</p><p>“Just before Newman killed her, yes.”</p><p>“What's going on with the hearts?”</p><p>“They have to be destroyed. To kill the demon. Or else it jumps. Like I did. To someone nearby.”</p><p>“Or dog?”</p><p>“Yes, animal, too.”</p><p>Vivian considered this as she drove slowly through the suburban sprawl. She had passed from residential into commercial, with closed strip malls and chain stores and franchise restaurants passing by. “When I went back for the bullets I saw the nurse. And Newman. Their chests are okay. I mean they're dead, still dead, no question, they didn't come back to life, or anything, like zombies. But their chests weren't cut open. How can that be? I watched you carve Newman open and pull out his heart.”</p><p>“I cut out the demon heart. The human heart is still there. I cut through the demon to get to its heart. Once the demon was dead the body returned to normal.”</p><p>“But they’re still dead.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Newman did look like himself again.” A twenty-four-hour gas station shone brightly before them in the darkened commercial district. Vivian glanced down at herself. Then at Kody. “You doing good enough for me to stop and get cleaned up? I can't walk into a supermarket like this, covered in blood. They'll call the cops.”</p><p>“Sure. Just be fast.”</p><p>When Vivian pulled into the gas station there was one car parked at the pumps, its owner not present, and another car parked on the side. She parked before the door and slipped her shoes on, then snatched her clean blouse out of the back seat and hopped out.  After tugging the bloody shirttail down to conceal the hilt of the butcher knife sticking out of the back of her pants and the grip of the gun jammed into the front, she slammed the door and hurried into the mart.</p><p>Vivian rushed inside to find the lone male clerk behind the register staring warily at her. “Can I use your bathroom?  To clean up?” She glanced down at herself. Unconvincingly, “I wrecked my car.”</p><p>The clerk's fingers settled upon the phone laying on the counter, staring apprehensively. “Need an ambulance?”</p><p>“I could sure use one. But I don't have insurance. I'll drive myself to the hospital. I just want to wash some of this blood off first.” She held up her clean blouse. “Put on a clean shirt. Okay?”</p><p>“Sure. But someone's in there.”</p><p>Vivian shook her head in irritation as she walked to the small one-person restroom in back. She knocked on the door. “Hey! It's an emergency! About done in there?!” Awaiting a response, Vivian looked back at the clerk. He watched her warily from behind the counter, hand now firmly grasping the phone.</p><p>The door burst open. Whacked Vivian, knocking her down. An elderly woman leaped out of the bathroom snarling.  Her open drooling mouth revealed vicious fangs. Stunned, sprawled helplessly on her back, Vivian stared up in horror at the monstrous grandma towering above her. The clerk fumbled with his phone. Belying her age, the woman sprinted over and vaulted across the counter. The clerk just stared, frozen with fear. She tackled him, knocking the phone from his hands as they crashed to the floor behind the counter. The clerk screamed. Then silence.</p><p>Vivian, still dazed, struggled to her feet. The woman raised up from behind the counter covered in blood, her fangs and claws dripping fresh blood. She leered at Vivian. Vivian backed away, desperately digging for both the gun and the knife. She pulled the gun out first. The woman jumped back across the counter and charged. The gun clicked on an empty chamber. She hadn't reloaded it. The woman slammed Vivian back against the wall. The gun flew out of her hand and skidded across the floor. Vivian, the breath knocked out of her, started to slide down the wall. But the old woman grabbed her with both hands and held her up. Then released one hand to softly caress Vivian's slack face.</p><p>That touch, with the long claws dragging across her skin, brought Vivian back to life. She couldn't scream, she was still gasping for air. She tried to twist away, but the frail-looking elderly woman held her fast. She was pinned helpless against the wall. The woman leaned in to kiss Vivian, deeply, passionately, smearing the clerk's blood from her lips onto Vivian's lips and all across her face. Vivian was horrified and disgusted, but couldn't escape the old woman's iron grip. The demon released one hand from Vivian to tear into her blouse, ripping it to shreds with her claws. Then she ripped Vivian's bra away. Smiling lustily, she licked the bared breasts with her long thick tongue, kissed her breasts with her bloody lips. She grabbed at Vivian's jeans, trying to open them.</p><p>“Demon!”</p><p>The woman raised up from Vivian's chest to jerk around. Kody kneeled weakly on the floor with the gun in both shaking hands aimed at her. At this distraction, Vivian pulled the butcher knife out and stabbed the woman in the side. She howled, releasing Vivian and staggering away.</p><p>Kody shot her. Fired again. Again. The woman staggered with each slug, crashing into a shelf of food. Vivian pulled the blade out of the woman's side and slashed her throat, nearly cutting her head off. The woman crumpled to the floor, packages of junk food tumbling down upon her. </p><p>Vivian glared furiously at Kody. “What are you doing in here?” Kody stared at her blankly as he slid limply to the floor, nearly unconscious. “If you die, if you allow my son to die, I’m cutting your heart out! Understand?” Kody nodded weakly, feebly trying to raise his arm to point at the fallen demon. Vivian glanced down at the bloody unmoving heap at her feet. “I know what I'm supposed to do!” </p><p>Vivian dropped down to the woman, rolling her over onto her back and raising the knife high. The woman's eyes snapped open and her hands flew up, grabbing Vivian's upraised arm. “Oh, please.” Vivian swung her other arm, punching the woman solidly in the jaw. With a surprised expression, she released Vivian's arm. Vivian then drove the knife through a bag of tortilla chips into her chest up to the hilt. The woman howled in pain. Vivian grabbed the knife with both hands and began hacking at her chest, sending tortilla chips flying. The woman's howls subsided to moans, her eyes closed once again as she grew lifelessly still. </p><p>While Vivian hacked determinedly, as blood and gore spurted everywhere, she looked up furiously at Kody. “I had this under control. While she was drooling all over me I got my hand on my knife. You didn't have to butt in.” Vivian stopped hacking and reached into the cut-open chest. “I swear if Kody dies you're next.” Vivian yanked out the heart. She dropped the butcher knife and grabbed it with both hands, averting her face as she squeezed with all the pent-up fury in her soul. The heart popped, spraying slime and gore all over. It dripped from her face, her hair, her arms, her shredded blouse. \"Shit! I hate this!\"</p><p>Yet Vivian grinned as she held up the smashed slimy heart. “See? I'm getting good at this.” She dropped the heart then, with a wicked smile, picked up several chips and stuffed them into her mouth. \"I've had worse salsa,\" she said as she picked up the butcher knife and stood. Munching, she pulled the shreds of the blood and gore and slime soaked-blouse off, then snatched up the clean blouse from the floor. “I'll be right out. Don't go nowhere.” Vivian went into the bathroom. While Kody stared weakly after her, letting the gun drop from his hands.</p><p>When Vivian emerged a minute later clad in her clean blouse, most of the blood and slime and gore had been washed from her face and hands. Without a word she swept Kody up in her arms and carried him outside. Holding her son's limp body easily in one arm, she opened the passenger door with her other. She carefully sat Kody into the front passenger seat and buckled him in. Slamming the door, Vivian rushed around to the driver door and flung it open. She tossed her old shredded blouse and bra and the knife into the back, then tossed the gun into Kody's lap. \"Reload. I know you got enough strength to do it because you just did it.\" He dug in her purse for more bullets as she climbed in behind the wheel. Starting the car, her expression softened as she looked Kody over. He appeared paler and feebler than before as he fumbled with the gun. “You doing okay? You and Kody?”</p><p>Kody nodded. Vivian peeled from the parking lot. “Police. Will be. All over. Now.”</p><p>Vivian slowed at the mention of police. “So what's the plan?”</p><p>“Get off the road. Hide out somewhere. Safe.”</p><p>“For how long?”</p><p>“Daylight.”</p><p>“That's only a couple hours.”</p><p>“Only?”</p><p>“Yeah. Well, I know a place. After I get you some medicine.” Vivian concentrated on driving. It was very late, the streets nearly deserted. As she drove legally within the speed limit she kept glancing at Kody. “Why don't the demons just kill me? Why do they keep trying to rape me?”</p><p>“That's their weakness.”</p><p>“What is?”</p><p>“Their lust. To experience the physical world. They can't resist. That's how I escaped from Newman.”</p><p>“Yeah? How's that?”</p><p>“The demon didn't cut my heart out right away. He wanted to play with the nurse first. While she was barely alive. That gave me a chance to get away.”</p><p>“To Kody.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“So what's your weakness?”</p><p>“You. And your son.”</p><p>Vivian laughed, nearly hysterical. “My guardian angel. Is my son.”</p><p>“Is in your son. I'm not your son.”</p><p>“Let's see,” Vivian's laughter subsided as she mentally tallied up. “Tonight, so far, there's been six deaths.  Six horrible gruesome deaths. Awful bloodthirsty for an angel.”</p><p>“Those deaths were necessary. To save you. And your son.”  </p><p>Vivian turned into the parking lot of a brightly-lit supermarket. There were only three other cars, all parked to the side in the employee area. She parked in front of the door. Vivian wiped the gory knife with the shreds of her old blouse, then slipped it into the back of her pants, her shirttail hanging out to conceal it. She paused to look Kody over. Pale, eyes closed, unmoving, blood-soaked clothes, all of the many deep claw-marks and bite-wounds, he seemed more dead than alive. She leaned over to kiss his bloody cheek. “Please don't let my son die.”</p><p>A faint smile turned up the corners of Kody's mouth. “Was that kiss for your son? Or for me?”</p><p>“That was for Kody.” Vivian leaned back over to kiss Kody on the lips. Then she leaned away, deeply disturbed. “That was for you. Whoever. Whatever. You are.” Vivian quickly opened the door and climbed out. Kody, loosely holding the gun, watched her scurry across to the supermarket entrance.</p><p>Vivian walked into the brightly-lit store. The lone cashier, a young woman, watched her with a wary expression. Vivian glanced down at herself. There was dried blood and worse on her jeans, dried blood and worse in her hair. She looked back up and said, unconvincingly, “I was in a car wreck.”  Vivian bolted toward the pharmacy.</p><p>“Are you all right?” the cashier asked.</p><p>“No. I need medicine.” Vivian dashed through the shelves. She grabbed extra-strength pain relievers, several different antibacterial ointments, several different kinds of bandages. Dumping all this into a basket, she hurried up to the cashier. By then two young male night clerks had come to the front of the store, anxiously watching her.</p><p>“You want me to call an ambulance?” the cashier asked.</p><p>Vivian dumped the contents of her basket out onto the belt. “No insurance. I'll tough it out.” Vivian pulled her wallet from her back pocket and took out several bills. The cashier finally began scanning the items.  </p><p>The front door opened. Vivian looked to see two policemen walk in. They approached cautiously. “That your car with the kid in it?” one of them asked.</p><p>“Yeah. He's my son.”</p><p>“Awfully late to have him out.”</p><p>Vivian nodded toward the merchandise she was buying. “Emergency.”</p><p>“What kind of emergency?”</p><p>“There was this dog, this pit bull.”</p><p>The cashier butted in. “You said there was a car wreck.” Vivian glared at her like she could throttle her. The night clerks moved forward from behind, ready to come to the cashier's aid. The two policemen advanced from the front.  </p><p>Vivian looked all around. She was surrounded and cut off. “I've got to get back to my son. He needs me.”</p><p>“Your son will be taken care of.” one of the policemen said. Vivian snatched up her items, not waiting for them to be bagged.  </p><p>“You've got to pay for this,” the cashier demanded.  </p><p>Vivian ignored her, eyes on the approaching policemen. “Are you two really cops?”</p><p>The policemen glanced wearily at each other. The other policeman said, “Full moon.”</p><p>The first added, “Yeah, it's that time of the month, all right.” They both looked to Vivian, smiling grimly. “Come with us. We'll go check on your son.” Vivian froze, holding her items close to her chest.</p><p>The first policeman pulled out his revolver. The other one glanced curiously at him. “There's no need for that.”</p><p>“Can't be too careful with a full moon.” He nodded toward Vivian. “Cuff her.  I'll cover you.”</p><p>Vivian backed away. She glanced over her shoulder. The two young night clerks were only two steps behind. Nowhere to run. The other policeman shook his head, staring queerly at his partner. “You really think it's necessary?”</p><p>Briskly, “I do.”</p><p>With a sigh, “Then you fill out the paperwork.” The other policeman took out his handcuffs and approached Vivian. The first one bashed him on the back of the head with the butt of his revolver. That officer crumpled at his feet. The cashier screamed and ran out from behind the register to join the night clerks, who had retreated several steps.  </p><p>Vivian's eyes flashed with hatred and disgust. “Shit!” She dropped her items onto the belt and whipped out her knife. “You try to rape me and I'll cut your heart out.”  </p><p>The policeman holstered his gun, then snatched up the handcuffs the other officer had dropped. He approached Vivian, offering the cuffs. “Cuff me.” Vivian stared dumbly. “Come on. Quick.” Vivian held her knife out threateningly as she cautiously stepped up to snatch away the handcuffs. The policeman turned around, holding his hands together behind his back.</p><p>As awareness dawned, her anger flared. “You left Kody!”</p><p>“I'll get back to him as soon as I'm cuffed. Now do it and run.”  </p><p>Vivian stuffed the knife back into her jeans then quickly snapped the cuffs onto the policeman's wrists. “You're cuffed! Now go!” The policeman slumped, falling across the belt. Vivian effortlessly lifted him up from on top of her items and flung him off to the side. Then she snatched up her selections and dropped the bills she still held. She glanced back as she dashed toward the doors. “Keep the change.” Vivian ran out, leaving the cashier and the night clerks staring after her in disbelief.</p><p>Kody was sitting lifelessly with his eyes closed in the passenger seat when Vivian sprinted past the police cruiser parked next to her car. She slung open the driver door, dropping several items. “Shit.” Vivian flung the medical supplies she still held into the back seat, then stooped to gather up what she'd dropped and fling it back there, too. “Are you still alive?”</p><p>Very weakly, “Yes.”</p><p>Vivian fell in, slamming the door.  “You better be.”</p><p>“”Those cuffs. Won't. Hold. Long.”</p><p>Vivian stared panic-stricken at her near-death son. Then started her car and roared away. “You said if you left Kody he'd die.”</p><p>“Had to. You. Were. Trapped.”</p><p>Vivian sped out of the lot onto the highway. “But you didn’t. He didn't. Die. What else have you lied to me about?” When he didn’t answer, she began crying. “Don't let him die. Please. Don't let him die.”</p><p>“I need. To. Concen. Trate.”</p><p>“Okay. I'll shut up.” Vivian looked away to the road, desperately trying to stop crying, wiping the tears from her face as she sped down the highway. Kody, eyes closed and brow furrowed in concentration, sat rigidly motionless beside her.</p><p>A short while later they pulled into the parking lot at Newman’s apartment complex. No one else was stirring in the bright night. She gathered up the butcher knife and the gun and the just-purchased medicine, then scooped an unconscious Kody up in her arms and kicked the passenger door shut. At the entry door she freed one hand to punch in the code. Walking down a dingy little hall to Newman's door, she dropped what could be dropped onto the floor, then bent over easily to gently prop Kody up against a wall. He appeared ghastly pale and as limp as a ragdoll. When Vivian unlocked the front door to Newman's apartment a small dog rushed up, barking frantically. The dog stopped barking upon recognizing Vivian and rushed out into the hall, its tail wagging furiously. “Paul. Get back.”</p><p>Vivian gathered her dropped articles, then stooped and swept a floppy Kody up in her arms, effortlessly carrying him inside the apartment. The dog followed on her heels. It was a small dirty crummy living room she walked into. Everything was stained, the carpet and curtains and walls and ceiling and furniture. Vivian laid the boy out on the couch. As she went back to close and lock the door she nearly tripped over the scampering dog. He was very glad to see her. But Vivian had no time for him. “Paul. Go to your pillow.” The dog lowered his head, then softly padded across the room and dropped down onto a pillow in the corner. From there he watched closely as Vivian hurried back to the couch. “Wake up.” No response. Vivian shook Kody's shoulder gently. His eyes cracked open. “How you doing in there?” He glanced around in confusion. “Newman's apartment. We can hide out here until morning.” Vivian looked around forlornly. “Poor Newman.” Vivian looked back to Kody. “No time to grieve now. Or I'll be saying poor Kody.”</p><p>Vivian dumped all the medical supplies she had purchased on the coffee table. Then she stripped Kody of his ripped and torn bloody clothing, leaving him only in his undershorts. Even that garment was soaked in blood. She sadly surveyed his inert ripped and torn bloody body, choking back a sob. “Oh, God, Kody.” Vivian hurried off to the bathroom, quickly returning with several soapy washcloths and several towels. She began cleaning Kody up. “Let me know if I hurt you. Or Kody, I mean. I don’t really care if I hurt you.”</p><p>Kody watched her dispassionately. “Could you really carve my heart out?” Vivian glanced sharply at him but continued washing. \"Could you really stab a knife into your son's chest?”</p><p>“If my son was already dead, yes, I could. I would.”</p><p>Kody managed a grim smile. “You say.”</p><p>“You're talking better. Are you feeling better?”</p><p>“Yes. I think your son is going to survive. The pit bull attack, at least.”</p><p>“Then fill me in.”</p><p>Kody stared at her long and hard as she bathed him. “We have to survive the night. After sunrise you can take your son to a hospital.”</p><p>“What's so special about tonight?”</p><p>“It's a supermoon.”</p><p>“Why is that important?”</p><p>“It’s when a full moon coincides with the moon’s closest approach to Earth. The full moon’s normal effect is magnified by its nearness. The attractive force of a supermoon is strong enough to draw demons into your world. Like the moon draws the tides up from the ocean.”</p><p>“So if we make it through tonight, then we're home free.”</p><p>“Until the next supermoon.”</p><p>“When will that be?”</p><p>“Three to six supermoons occur throughout a cycle of fourteen months.”</p><p>“Then it happens again? More demons?”</p><p>Kody smiled. “It's a never-ending struggle.”</p><p>“That's why people go whacko when there’s a full moon? Demons possess them?”</p><p>“During a supermoon.  But it happens regularly enough that people attribute it to any full moon.”  </p><p>“And angels come to protect us from the demons?” Vivian paused again, for a response. Not getting any, she continued. “Why do I need protecting?”</p><p>“Your baby needs protecting.”</p><p>Vivian froze, rag in hand. She glanced down at her stomach. “I'm not showing.  How'd you know?”</p><p>“Your baby was conceived under a supermoon.”</p><p>Vivian clouded over as she thought back, trying to remember. “How could that be? I'm only two months.”</p><p>“Supermoons don’t occur regularly. They can occur only a month apart. It has to do with perigees and apogees.” Kody watched her closely.</p><p>“So everyone who conceives under a supermoon gets attacked like this?”</p><p>“No. There's something special about your child.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Kody closed his eyes, trembling. “That's enough for now. I have to save my strength.”</p><p>“Just one more thing?” Kody's eyes flickered open. “What's your name? Your real name?”</p><p>“Armon.”</p><p>Vivian gazed down on Kody with great affection. “Thank you, Armon. For fighting to save us.” Vivian gently laid her head on his wounded chest, hugging him gently. Kody watched her, not quite as dispassionately as before.</p><p>Later that night Kody, covered in bandages, his many wounds dressed and treated, sat alertly upright on the couch. He now wore shorts and a tee shirt that were huge on him, obviously Newman's clothes. Loosely holding the gun, he looked anxiously back and forth from the front door to the hall.</p><p>Until Vivian walked in from the bathroom, the butcher knife in hand. She had showered and changed into clean clothes. “I'm glad I keep clothes over here. I feel better. How are you doing?”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>She glanced at a clock. “Almost four. Sunup is when?”</p><p>“Around seven”.  </p><p>Vivian walked over to sit beside Kody, setting the knife aside. “So if I survive tonight, and there are no more supermoons anytime soon, then I give birth in prison.”</p><p>“No you won't.”</p><p>“Six people are dead.”</p><p>“The demons killed them, or they were killed in self-defense.”</p><p>“What jury will buy this story? Those people at the supermarket. And those cops. They saw me.”</p><p>“What do you think they saw?” Vivian stared blankly at him. “Go look in the mirror.”</p><p>“I just did.”</p><p>“Go look again.”</p><p>Vivian slowly rose, gazing questioningly at Kody. Then she walked out to the bathroom and looked into the mirror. Staring back at her was a much taller woman in her late fifties, with long graying hair and seventy pounds heavier. Vivian stared at the incomprehensible reflection. Then dashed out and ran up to Kody. “What's going on?”</p><p>Kody managed a smile. “That's how you look to everyone else tonight. Your fingerprints will be different, any DNA you leave behind will be different.” Vivian dropped down onto the couch, staring at Kody in wonder. “You really aren't responsible for anyone's death. I'm just making sure you don't get blamed for them.”</p><p>Vivian smiled warmly at Kody. “My guardian angel.”</p><p>“What are you going to name her?”</p><p>Vivian's smile faded. “It's a girl? I didn't know it was a girl.” Kody averted his eyes. “I didn't want to know.”</p><p>“Sorry.”</p><p>Vivian studied Kody closely. He seemed embarrassed. “So you're not infallible.”</p><p>Kody looked back to her, then down at his many wounds. “That should be obvious.”</p><p>Very tenderly, “I owe you my life. And my son's life. And I can't even touch you.” Vivian reached out to gently stroke his face.</p><p>“This is the only way we'll ever touch.” Kody reached up to gently stroke Vivian's face. She closed her eyes, smiling, luxuriating in his touch. A brief tender moment.</p><p>Until his hand drifted down to fondle a breast. Vivian slapped the hand away. \"Don't do that!\" Kody looked away, frowning. \"You're my son. You're in my son. Don't make him do something disgusting like that. To his mother.\"</p><p>The dog barked. It was by the door, leash in mouth. Both seemed relieved by the distraction. “Paul needs to go out,” Vivian said.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“He has to. It's like torture, not taking him out.”</p><p>“It's too dangerous.”</p><p>Vivian stood. “It's been a while. Nothing's happened. Maybe we gave them the slip.”</p><p>“Maybe they're waiting just outside the door.”</p><p>“I'll take the gun.” Vivian stuffed the gun into her jeans. “Won't take but a second.” She put the leash on the dog. “I'll be careful.” She unlocked the door and eased it open, leaning out to look around. Nothing stirred in the hallway. She leaned back in to smile nervously at Kody. “We'll be real quick.” Vivian opened the door wide and the dog hurried out, pulling Vivian along with him. While Kody watched anxiously from the couch, picking up the knife and balancing it in his hand.</p><p>Vivian hurried out after the dog and locked the door behind her. The dog led her down the hall to the front entrance. She stopped to look out through the glass door. Nothing was stirring in the bright night. Vivian pulled the gun out and released the safety. Taking a deep breath, she unlocked the door and opened it a crack. The leash unwound as the dog slipped outside, while she anxiously watched.  A brief moment later the dog ran up to the door. Vivian opened it a crack again, letting the dog back in.  She quickly closed and locked the front door, then hurried down the hall back to Newman's apartment.</p><p>Vivian stopped to unlock Newman's door. The apartment door across from Newman's flew open and a male hand reached out to grab Vivian by the hair. With a mighty yank, she was pulled off her feet backwards into the apartment. She screamed as the door was slammed shut, trapping the dog out in the hall. Paul barked.</p><p>Vivian was yanked inside by a strapping virile young man clad only in long-legged grey undershorts. The door was slammed shut and locked by a luscious young woman in a flimsy black negligee. As the man encircled Vivian's waist with one arm, he grabbed the arm holding the gun with his other. While they struggled for possession, the woman rushed up to pry the gun from her hand.</p><p>“Kody! Kody!” Vivian screamed.</p><p>The woman punched Vivian in the face. “Be quiet.”</p><p>“Let her scream,” the man answered. “We want him to come.”  </p><p>Smiling wickedly, the woman aimed the gun at the front door. “Yes, Armon, come save your child.”</p><p>Vivian shook her head, trying to clear it from the punch. “His?  Child?”</p><p>“He didn't tell you?” The man pulled at her clothes with both hands.</p><p>The woman frowned back at them. “Don't ruin her. Yet. I want some.”</p><p>He kissed Vivian on the face, the neck, the shoulders. She didn’t resist, she had other things on her mind. “How can it be his child?” The man tore her blouse open and pawed her.  </p><p>While the woman watched hungrily. “He possessed your lover. The night your child was conceived.” Vivian stared at her, more disturbed by what she heard than by what was being done to her.</p><p>Unable to resist any longer, the woman rushed up to the pair. She tore open Vivian's jeans and yanked them down, dropping to her knees to kiss her bared stomach. As the pair assaulted Vivian from front and behind, their features began changing, turning demonic.</p><p>Vivian looked with revulsion from one to the other, but still was focused on what they were saying rather than doing. “But he's an angel!”</p><p>Both demons paused their assault to laugh. “An angel?” the man asked. “He told you he was an angel?”</p><p>“He's a demon,” the woman answered. “Same as us.”  </p><p>The man, having ripped her blouse off, now pulled her bra up and dug his fingers into her breasts. While the woman tugged her jeans down to her feet and yanked them off, taking the shoes with them. Vivian closed her eyes in misery, trying to make sense of what she has just heard.</p><p>There was a banging on the front door. The demons froze, both looking. The woman stood with the gun. “It's him.” She ran to the door, ready to fire.</p><p>The door exploded! The woman exploded! Outside in the hallway, seen through the blasted door, Kody lay sprawled on the floor, bowled over by the kick from both barrels of a double-barreled shotgun.</p><p>Vivian came to life, struggling maniacally. The man, surprised by the strength and suddenness of her attack, lost his grip. Vivian slipped half-way free and lunged for the gun on the floor beside the shotgun-blasted woman. The male demon fought to keep hold of Vivian, and she pulled him down to the floor with her while flailing wildly for the gun. He landed on top of Vivian, fighting to restrain her. She screamed and nearly stopped struggling as his claws dug into her back.    </p><p>Kody sat upright, somewhat, and threw the knife. It stabbed deeply into the man’s throat. He released Vivian, grabbing the hilt with both hands trying to pull it out. Vivian snatched up the gun and began firing. The man was knocked backward to the floor, with the knife still embedded. Vivian scrambled on hands and knees across to his fallen body. She yanked the knife from his throat, then stabbed him in the chest. She was quickly bathed in blood once again.</p><p>“Damn!” Vivian hacked at his chest. Then reached in and yanked out his heart. Holding it at arm's length and turning her head and squinting shut her eyes, she squeezed. It burst, spewing slime and gore all over her. “Damn! Damn!” </p><p>Vivian tossed the heart down, then crawled on top of  the prone woman. She raised her arm to stab the demon's chest. But stopped to glance out into the hall at Kody. “Liar.” Kody stared blankly at her, collapsed limply against the opposite wall. </p><p>The female demon's eyes snapped open. She grabbed Vivian's upraised arm with both hands, fighting to keep the knife at bay. Vivian ignored her, staring at Kody with loathing. “I’m cutting yours out before the night’s over.” Finally, she looked away from Kody to glance disdainfully down at the wounded female demon pinned beneath her. Vivian smiled sweetly. “I’m never washing my stomach again, where you kissed me.” She punched the woman with her free hand, pounded her face again and again. It was quickly beaten to a bloody mush. At last, the demon could hold onto Vivian's arm no longer. Vivian plunged the knife to the hilt into the woman’s chest. She howled, flailing futilely at Vivian as she was stabbed repeatedly. </p><p>Vivian didn't even bother to watch what she was doing as she looked back out into the hall at Kody while continuing to stab and slash. “You raped me disguised as Newman. And you claim to be an angel?” The howls subsided as the woman grew still. \"No wonder you grabbed my tit. You're no better than these monsters.\" Vivian stopped hacking to reach in and pull her heart out. “You take care of this one.” Vivian hurled the heart through the shattered door into the hall. It struck Kody in the chest, splattering blood all over him, then bounced off to the floor. Screams filled the hall.  </p><p>“Shit.” Vivian jumped up, hastily tugging her blood-stained underwear into place as she charged out into the hallway, while covered in blood and gore and slime and  brandishing a bloody knife dripping gore. More screams, followed by loudly slammed doors. Vivian looked up and down the hallway. Several of the braver neighbors in robes and pajamas only then retreated back into their apartments. Vivian looked down at Kody splayed at her feet. He looked weakly up at her. She raised a leg high. Kody flinched, expecting to be kicked. Instead, she stomped the heart on the floor beside him with her bare foot. It burst open, spewing more slime and gore. Another scream, another slammed door. Vivian ignored it as she glared down at Kody. “I want you out of my son. Now.”</p><p>“No time. Neighbors have called. Police are coming.”</p><p>Vivian looked herself over. “I need more clothes.” Vivian looked into the demons' apartment at the gun on the floor. “More bullets.”</p><p>“No time. We have to go. Now.” Kody struggled to stand.</p><p>Vivian grabbed his arm and roughly hauled him up to his feet. “I'm supposed to trust you?”</p><p>Kody struggled to pull his tee shirt off. Vivian roughly yanked it the rest of the way off. “I don't know what they told you. But I'm still trying to save your life.”</p><p>“You mean the life of your baby.” Kody shrugged as he stooped to pick up the shotgun, while Vivian yanked on Newman’s large tee shirt, which fit her like a sack. “When'd you find Newman's shotgun?”</p><p>“While you were in the shower.”</p><p>Vivian glanced down at herself, grossly filthy once again. “Yeah, lot of good that shower did me.”</p><p>Kody limped off down the hall toward the front door, using the shotgun as a crutch. Vivian dashed back into the demons' apartment to pick up the gun, then darted into Newman's apartment to snatch up her purse, then ran out into the hall ahead of Kody to open the door. He glanced up at her, smiling grimly. “So we're back to helping each other?”</p><p>\"So long as you don't go grabbing at my tits again. God, you don't know how disgusting it is for my son to do that.\"</p><p>Kody lowered his eyes as he limped outside. \"Sorry. A moment of weakness. Won't happen again.\"</p><p>\"It better not. But that's your weakness, right? Sex. Just like all the other demons.\" Vivian ran after him. \"But what choice do I have? You're holding my son hostage.”         Vivian propelled a hobbling Kody across the parking lot to her car. They could now hear sirens in the distance. Many people in Newman's apartment building were peeking out their windows as she opened the passenger door. Vivian shoved Kody and the shotgun into the front seat, then ran around the front of the car. She jumped in behind the wheel. Tossing the gun and the knife into the back seat, she dug through her purse for keys. Instead, she pulled out a handful of shotgun shells and bullets. She glanced up at Kody.</p><p>“I loaded you up.” Vivian dropped the ammo back into her purse and pulled out the keys. She started the car and sped out of  the lot, as the sirens grew louder. “You're a demon. Like all the others. Don't deny it.”</p><p>Kody looked around, then glanced at her speedometer. “Slow down.”</p><p>Vivian looked incredulously at him. “Still trying to protect your kid?”</p><p>“Just until dawn.” Vivian sat back, slowing down. She tried desperately to calm down. </p><p>Kody watched her closely. “It really was Newman. Making love to you. That night. I was just there.”</p><p>Vivian speared him with her eyes. “Don't try to sugarcoat it. Demon. Why did you lie to me? About being an angel?”</p><p>“If I'd told you I was a demon, would you have listened to anything else I had to say?” Vivian glanced back at him, her anger unappeased. “Besides, I'm different now.”</p><p>“Really? Let's see, there's been eight people brutally murdered tonight. So far. So you're not such a bad demon? You’re different now? Is that what you're trying to tell me?”</p><p>Kody glanced nervously behind him. “Let's get off the road. The whole town will be crawling with police. We've got guns and a bloody knife, and neither of us is dressed properly, and you're covered in blood and I'm all chewed up. We don't want to be pulled over.”  </p><p>Vivian looked herself and Kody over. “Yeah, we do look sort of suspicious.”</p><p>“We need to find a place to hide out for a couple more hours. Any ideas?” Vivian fell silent as she considered. Then she suddenly swerved at a high speed onto a narrow unmarked road, skidding on the gravel off the shoulder and barely keeping the car out of the ditch. “What's wrong?”</p><p>“Nothing’s wrong. I just thought of somewhere. Out in the country. Where Newman took me fishing.”</p><p>“Yuck. I hate fishing.”</p><p>Vivian laughed, looking at Kody in surprise. “That sounds like something my son would say.”</p><p>“That's not surprising. The longer I'm in him the more we rub off on each other.”</p><p>Vivian abruptly stopped laughing. “Then we've got to get you out real quick. I sure don't want a demon rubbing off on my son.”</p><p>Kody fell silent, nodding in grim resignation. “As soon as the sun rises I'll be forced out.”</p><p>“Good. Just don't rub off anymore. Understood?” Kody turned away without replying to look out the side window. While Vivian stared straight ahead, her demeanor set in stone.</p><p>Vivian drove at a reasonable speed on a dark deserted back road in the country, her gaze riveted straight ahead. Kody sat upright searching all about for peril. They traveled in total silence. Until Vivian glanced at Kody.  He met her worried look. “I knew something was different that night,\" she said. \"Newman was different. More assertive. More aroused. More virile. Like tonight. That was you?” Kody stared blankly at her. “He thought I was trying to trap him into marriage. Said I'd stopped taking the pill so I'd get pregnant. But I hadn't stopped.”</p><p>Kody smiled grimly. “No contraceptive would have been strong enough that night.”  </p><p>Vivian fell silent, remembering. “Poor Man. I did love him.”</p><p>“I know.” Vivian doubted him. “I do. You changed me.”  </p><p>Vivian let out a snort of a laugh, glancing down at her stomach. “Not as much as you changed me.”</p><p>“The emotions I felt that night. Passing both ways. He loved you, too, Vivian. He just wasn't very good at expressing it.”</p><p>Vivian began to quietly sob, remembering Newman, grieving. “How did that change you?”</p><p>“Yours and Newman's love for each other. I'd never experienced anything like it.”</p><p>“You were only there for the sex,” Vivian responded bitterly.</p><p>“I was. That's why I was so overwhelmed by the love. It surprised me. Affected me. Profoundly.”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“So I was no longer content. With what I was. I wanted more.” Kody looked away. He seemed embarrassed by what he was revealing. “The others sensed it. This change in me. So they set out to destroy me. And my baby.”</p><p>“Your baby?”</p><p>“Okay, yours and Newman's baby.” Kody reached out to touch Vivian's stomach.  “But part of me is in there.”</p><p>Vivian slapped his hand off. “So what is it? A demon? Am I going to give birth to Rosemary’s Baby?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Vivian looked away, staring out the windshield once again. Finally, she heaved a weary sigh and glanced back to Kody. He was still staring at her with worry? Concern? Compassion?  She nearly laughed. “Armon, I look at you and see my son. With an expression on his face that shouldn't be there for another ten years. If ever.”</p><p>“I'm sorry. But I'm not harming your son. I'm trying my best...”</p><p>“To keep him alive. I know. I know that. Thank you.” Vivian gazed tenderly at Kody. “How can I hate and care for someone so much at the same time?”</p><p>Almost pleading, “I want desperately to learn that.”</p><p>Vivian looked away, her eyes welling up with tears once again. She was an emotional wreck. She attempted to lighten up. “So what's to stop them from killing us at the next supermoon, whenever it happens? Or the one after that?”</p><p>“You haven't noticed?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You've gotten stronger. A lot stronger. You're feeding off the strength of every demon heart you’ve destroyed tonight.”</p><p>“I don't feel so strong.”</p><p>“Haven't you noticed the way you've been knocking these demons around?\"</p><p>Vivian laughed, remembering. “Yeah. I really did beat the shit out of two bitches tonight, didn't I?”</p><p>“Yes, you did.”</p><p>Vivian laughed raucously, venting some tension. “I am one mean bitch.”</p><p>A dark form darted out in the road before them. A deer. It froze in the headlights, staring directly at them. Vivian’s laugh twisted into a scream as she jammed on the brakes. THUD! The deer flew across the hood and smashed through the windshield. The car skidded off the road, bounced across a ditch. While the deer kicked wildly at Vivian and Kody. Still, she fought to maintain control. Until they smashed into a tree. While four powerful legs kicked. One hoof cracked Kody in the head. Two hooves pounded at Vivian’s arms as she tried to protect herself. When Vivian lowered her arms to release her seat belt a hoof cracked her in the face, snapping her head back. Kody hunkered down, desperately fighting to release his seat belt. A hoof cracked the back of his head.  </p><p>Vivian, finally, was free. She blocked two more kicks with her arm as she threw open her door and fell out. She sprang up off the ground and leaped onto the hood. Grabbing the deer by the head, she snapped its neck. The mauling legs grew still. Vivian pulled the deer from the hood and slung it off into the dark. She ran around to the passenger side and threw open the door. Kody, having loosened his seat belt, tumbled out to the ground at her feet.</p><p>“Kody! Armon!” Vivian dropped down to him. She turned his face up. </p><p>It was still, lifeless, with fresh blood running from several deep gashes. “Oh God!”</p><p>“No time. For prayers.” Vivian smothered Kody’s limp body in her arms, kissing him desperately. “Or for sex.”</p><p>Vivian released him immediately, with revulsion. “This isn’t sex. It’s love.”</p><p>Kody opened his eyes. “That was. No. Ordinary deer.”</p><p>“That was a demon?”</p><p>Kody looked beyond her, up to the sky. “Like the. Pit bull. Look up.” Vivian looked up. A bat crossed the full moon. “They’re following. Us.” Kody looked back to her close crying frantic face. “Do it.”</p><p>Vivian nodded with grim resignation as she picked Kody up and put him back in the car. She closed and locked the passenger door, then ran around to the other side, leaning in to find the gun. Which she handed to Kody, who was watching her with half-closed eyes. “This is for the demons. The other demons. So don’t shoot me. When I come back.” Vivian found the knife, then ran quickly out of the headlight beams into the darkness.</p><p>A moment later Vivian walked wearily back into the headlight beams carrying the bloody knife. She was covered in fresh blood and gore and slime. A bat swooped down to claw her face. Vivian screamed, swinging wildly at it with the knife. Another bat dove at her. And another. Vivian slashed at them with the knife as she ran to the car. She threw open the driver door and fell in. A bat flew in as she slammed the door. It clawed Vivian’s face, going for her eyes. She grabbed it by a wildly-flapping wing. She slammed it against the dash, again, and again. Until it grew still. “To hell with its heart.”  Vivian flung it out through the busted windshield.</p><p>“Will the? Car start?”</p><p>Vivian turned the key. The engine ground and ground. A bat flew in through the busted windshield. It clawed at Kody’s face. He fought with it, but couldn’t get hold of it. Vivian grabbed a wing and slammed it into the dash repeatedly. When it grew still she hurled it back out the busted windshield.  Then turned frantically to Kody. Blood streamed down his face from the many fresh slashes. “How many bats are out there?”</p><p>“Don’t know. Start the car.”</p><p>Vivian turned the key. The engine ground. Finally, it roared to life. Laughing maniacally, Vivian shifted into reverse and floored it. The car lurched back away from the tree. “Watch for the bats.”</p><p>“I’m watching. Drive.” Vivian backed the car uphill toward the road. And slammed down into the ditch. Where it stopped with a jolt. Vivian raced the engine, but the tires spun uselessly. “Stop. You’ll make. It worse.”  Vivian stopped racing the engine, staring fearfully out through the busted windshield for any trace of bats. “Get out. And push,\" Kody said. \"I’ll drive.”</p><p>Vivian burst into tears. \"The bats are out there.”</p><p>“A bat. Can’t kill you.”</p><p>“I hate bats. They’re horrible.”</p><p>“I can’t. Do it. You’re strong.”</p><p>“No I’m not.” Vivian sobbed.</p><p>“You are stronger. Than you know.”</p><p>“I don’t want to be strong.”</p><p>“There are more. Demons coming. Worse things than bats.” </p><p>Vivian looked to Kody with intense hatred and loathing. “My son would never make me do this.”</p><p>“A demon would.”</p><p>“You haven’t changed. Not a bit. You're as evil as all the other demons.” Vivian flung the door open and hopped out. Kody scooted across to behind the wheel, stretching to put his foot on the gas. Vivian ran down into the ditch to in front of the car. She squatted down with her back to the grill and grabbed the bumper with both hands.</p><p>A bat flew into her face. She shook her head madly, trying to shake it loose, but didn’t let go of the car. The bat hung on, ripping her face up. Screaming insanely, Vivian pushed so hard she rocked the car half-way up out of the ditch. The engine roared, and the car pulled the rest of the way out up onto the road. Vivian fell down into the ditch on her butt, as another bat swooped down into her hair. She swung blindly at the two bats, screaming, but they hovered and dodged her flailing hands.</p><p>A shot rang out. A bat fell on Vivian. Screaming anew, she knocked it off. The other bat flew away. Vivian scrambled to her feet, turned and looked. Kody held the gun with both hands propped up on the dash and the barrel sticking out through the broken windshield. “You drive.”</p><p>Vivian scrambled to her feet. “No shit.” Wiping the freely-flowing blood from her eyes, she staggered to the driver door. Threw it open. To find Kody still seated behind the wheel. “Move over.”</p><p>“I can’t.”</p><p>“Damn.” Vivian shoved him across to the passenger side. He cried out in pain. She jumped in and slammed the door. Shifting and racing away, she glanced venomously at Kody. “I’m getting sick of your uselessness.”</p><p>“I killed. A bat.”</p><p>“I killed two of them. With my bare hands. And that deer.” Finally, she looked back to the road. “Buckle the fuck up.”</p><p>Kody smirked. “Is that any way to talk to your son?”</p><p>Vivian slammed on the brakes, staring hard at Kody. “Don’t do that.” Kody looked blankly at her, the smirk fading. “Don’t smirk like that. When Kody gives me that smart-ass smirk I feel like choking him. And you’re not Kody. So I just might do it.”</p><p>Kody’s expression went stone cold. “I’m not trying to behave like your son. It just happens.”</p><p>“He won’t remember any of this? You said? Right?”</p><p>“I don’t think he will.” The two stared levelly at each other. “Let’s go. Before any more demons show up.”</p><p>Vivian leaned over to envelop Kody in her arms. “Please live.” A brief hug and a quick kiss on the cheek. Then Vivian released Kody, leaned away and smiled. \"That was better. You kept you hands off me that time.\"  She turned away to drive. The wrecked car rattled and weaved down the road. While above a bat flew along behind, following.</p><p>The car rattled up a narrow dirt lane to a secluded tree-lined river. The huge full moon shone down like a spotlight. Vivian pulled over behind a pick-up truck parked on the side of the lane and cut the sputtering engine off. Both doors creaked open. Vivian emerged with the knife and gun and her purse full of ammo, Kody emerged with the shotgun. He leaned on it heavily as a crutch. They looked all around for the driver of the truck. All they could see was a small campfire, a tackle box, and several fishing poles leaned up against an open folding chair. </p><p>“Drop your guns.”</p><p>Vivian and Kody searched the bushes for the voice. Kody whispered, “It’s okay. I don’t sense a demon here.” Taking hold of Vivian’s arm for support, Kody released the shotgun. His crutch toppled to the ground. </p><p>Smiling, Vivian stopped searching to look at Kody. “You know, I don’t either. It feels all right.” Vivian dropped her gun. “I can sense them now?”</p><p>“And the knife!” the voice from the bushes demanded.</p><p>Vivian dropped her knife and purse. A blinding light shone on them. They tried to shield their eyes but were defenseless.</p><p>“My God. What happened to you two?”</p><p>“We’ve got some bad people following us,\" Vivian told him. \"You better clear out before they get here.”</p><p>A shadowy form emerged from the brush, carrying a large flashlight and a pistol. “Why are they following you?”</p><p>“They’re trying to kill us,” Vivian answered.</p><p>“Looks like they’ve nearly succeeded.”</p><p>“Can you turn that light off? We need to be able to see.”  </p><p>He considered. Then cut it off, and also lowered his gun half-way. “Sure. It’s bright enough tonight without it.” He walked toward them. As he neared, he could see their many injuries even better. “My God, how are you two still on your feet?”</p><p>Kody hobbled toward the river. “Be careful,\" Vivian admonished. \"Don't fall in.”</p><p>Kody glanced back at her with the hated smirk. “Yes, Mother.”</p><p>“What did I tell you about that?”</p><p>“Sor-ry!” Vivian took a threatening step toward Kody. Then stopped, looking guiltily back at the fisherman. </p><p>“Go ahead and belt him,\" he urged her. \"I’ve got three of my own.” </p><p>Kody limped up to the river's edge. He grew motionless, staring out at the dark water. Vivian walked to right behind him, looking all around. Everything was still, quiet. No sound whatsoever. “We're in the country,\" she said. \"Shouldn't we be hearing crickets, frogs, owls?  Something?”</p><p>The fisherman looked all around. “You’re right. It has got quiet. They were out earlier.”</p><p>        All three looked up at hearing a soft rumble. Vivian clutched Kody tightly to her. “Can you feel it?” Kody asked.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“They found us.” He turned to the fisherman. “You better get out of here.”</p><p>“He’s right,\" Vivian added. \"You do not want to be here.”</p><p>The roar of a motorcycle grew louder. The fisherman ran off into the bushes. Just as a headlight beam flashed on the lane. Vivian faced the light, stepping in front of Kody. The roar grew very loud as the headlight beam of a motorcycle swept to a halt. A large biker killed the engine, and he and his leather-clad biker girl climbed off. Other engines could then be heard. A bread delivery truck pulled up, and the driver climbed out. A minivan filled with rolled-up newspapers pulled up, and a newspaperman climbed out. A coyote crept up alongside the vehicles.</p><p>“Damn,” Vivian exclaimed. She grabbed Kody and tossed him off into the bushes. The biker pulled a sawed-off shotgun from his bike. Vivian sprinted to Newman’s shotgun laying on the ground. The biker fired. The blast knocked Vivian off her feet. Bleeding freely from the blast, Vivian rolled up to the shotgun and lay prone on her belly, elbows propped on the ground as she cocked. She fired. The blast knocked the biker off his feet. The biker girl, snarling in fury, charged, pulling a knife from a sheath at her waist. Vivian sprang up and swung the shotgun like a bat, smashing the biker girl’s face.  She crashed to the ground at her feet.</p><p>“Their hearts,\" Kody called out from the bushes. \"Don’t forget their hearts.”</p><p>Vivian looked to see Kody watching from the bushes. The coyote saw him, too. And charged. Vivian snatched up the biker girl’s knife and ran the coyote down. She intercepted him just before he reached Kody. Vivian jumped on the coyote, stabbing it.  The two rolled across the ground, Vivian slashing and stabbing as the coyote bit and clawed. Finally, the coyote grew still in her arms.</p><p>“The heart,” Kody called out.</p><p>“I know. But I got other stuff to do.” An engine roared to life. Vivian looked to see the newspaperman had climbed back into his minivan and started his engine. His headlights cut on, blinding Vivian and Kody. Vivian jumped up and ran blindly into the open, to draw him away from Kody. The minivan raced from the lane across the ground directly at her. Vivian ran alongside the river. The minivan hit her, knocking her out into the water. She sank from view. Unable to stop, the minivan crashed into the river. The newspaperman climbed out into the shallow water, looked around for her body.</p><p>Vivian sprang up out of the water behind him. She grabbed his head and snapped his neck, like she had done the deer. He sank lifeless at her feet.</p><p>“Here!” Vivian looked to see Kody holding up the biker girl’s now-bloody knife. \"I got the coyote.” He tossed the knife hilt-first toward Vivian. </p><p>She reached out for it. A shot rang out. The bullet hit Vivian's outstretched arm. As her wounded arm dropped, the knife flew past her into the river. Looking, she saw the bakery driver standing beside his truck with a gun aimed at her. He shot again. And again. Vivian took a bullet in the shoulder, the other in her chest. She dropped to her knees in the river’s edge. The driver confidently advanced, firing again. This shot hit her in the other shoulder, spinning her around backwards into the water. She rolled over onto her back, keeping her head barely high enough to breathe as she bled profusely.</p><p>The driver walked confidently up to her, gun aimed. He towered above her, as she lay helpless at his feet. But he didn’t shoot. Instead, he kneeled in the water beside her. Keeping the gun trained on her with one hand, with the other he grabbed Newman's tee shirt and yanked it up to her waist. With a leer that grew ever more demented, he reached down into the water and tore her panties off.</p><p>Vivian spread her legs as if offering the demon easier access. The bakery driver became so absorbed in assaulting her crotch he didn't notice the tensing of her leg muscles. Until Vivian kicked mightily. She toppled him and sent his gun flying off into deeper water. The driver scrambled back up to his feet. Vivian flailed about, but was unable to rise. The driver leaped on her, grabbing her throat and forcing her back down. Laying atop her, he shoved her head under the shallow water. Vivian struggled futilely in his grip, her shotgun-blasted bullet-ridden upper body unable to accomplish anything. The bakery driver grinned demonically as he throttled her underwater, as he watched her eyes close and her body grow still.</p><p>Suddenly, both legs flew up out of the water to encircle the driver. She pulled him down close with a scissors lock around his shoulders. Her eyes flashed open and her head lunged up, mouth wide. She sank her teeth into his throat and ripped it out. The driver looked down in amazement. Then collapsed on her. Vivian wriggled out from underneath him, spitting flesh and blood and gore from her mouth, gasping for air. She sat up in the shallow water, looking madly around.</p><p>“I’m over here!” Kody kneeled before the biker girl’s lifeless body with Vivian's butcher knife. He plunged it deep into her chest, again and again. Until he yanked out her bloody heart.</p><p>“Jesus! What kind of monsters are you people!” The fisherman emerged from the bushes, waving his gun wildly from Kody to Vivian. Kody squeezed the heart until it burst, spewing blood and slime all over his already-saturated body. He crawled with the knife toward the two bodies in the river with Vivian. “I got the coyote, and the Biker, and her. We need to get these two.” A bat swooped down and bit Kody’s hand. With a scream of pain, he dropped the knife.</p><p>Vivian struggled to her knees, then on to her feet, then staggered up out of the river. The bat flew up to Kody's face. He swatted weakly at it, but he had practically no strength left. The bat latched onto his face, clawing and biting. Vivian ran up, her wounded arms hanging useless at her sides, and dropped to her knees to bite the bat. The bat’s wings flapped wildly as it tried to escape her clenched teeth. Vivian snapped her head powerfully from side to side. Until she bit the bat in half, sending part of its body hurtling away. She spat the other half out of her mouth to the ground. </p><p>Vivian fell wailing upon Kody. His body lay lifeless beneath her. “Kody! Don’t die now!” Kody mumbled something, otherwise motionless with eyes closed. Vivian leaned in close. “What? I didn’t hear you.”</p><p>Weakly, “I'm going back. The night's ending. The supermoon is waning.” Vivian looked up. The night sky was growing pale. In the east, the sky was lightening. The full moon was fainter, no longer dominating the sky as it had all night. “It’s releasing the demons. They’re slipping out of your world back into their world. Our world.\" He smiled faintly. \"So you don't have to cut out those last two hearts in the river. The demons are leaving. You’re safe now.”</p><p>“Are you going back, too?” Kody nodded slightly. “What will happen to you? When you go back?” Kody remained still. “They'll destroy you, won't they?”</p><p>“It doesn't matter.”</p><p>“It does matter!”</p><p>“I've known love. Better to die with that than continue an eternity with evil.”</p><p>“What about Kody?”</p><p>“He’ll live.”</p><p>“And my baby? Is she all right?”</p><p>Kody opened his eyes and looked mournfully at her stomach. “I’m sorry. I did the best I could.”</p><p>“Is my baby dead? Our baby? Dead? Is she dead?”</p><p>“Not yet. But she’s dying. From all the trauma. I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Don’t be sorry! Do something! She's all that's left of Newman!” Kody closed his eyes, growing limp. “No! You're not going back! Just to die! We still need you! Our baby needs you! You said she’s not dead yet!”</p><p>Kody opened his eyes and looked away from her, up toward the faintly glowing moon. “I can't help it.”</p><p>Vivian happily smothered Kody with her bloody body, kissing him all over with her bloody gory lips. “I'm not letting you go. To be destroyed. When we still need you.”</p><p>“I'm being pulled back. The moon is losing its grip on me.”</p><p>Vivian wrapped her legs tightly around him. “What about my grip? My arms are gone, but my grip is still strong. And getting stronger. Can't you feel that?\" She squeezed him with her legs even more tightly. \"You have no idea how strong I feel. Strong enough to hold you here.” Vivian worked the big baggy tee shirt up and leaned over to press Kody's face to her bare stomach. “Here, Armon. Here.” Kody opened his eyes to slits and gazed questioningly up at her, his face pressed tightly to her stomach. “Possess her. Keep my daughter alive. Like you’ve done my son all night.” Kody closed his eyes. “She needs you. I need you. I love you.” Vivian shook him violently with her clenched legs. Until he cracked his eyelids again. “You want to learn what love is? I'll sure as hell show you. Me and Kody and the baby. Your baby. Our baby. That only you can keep alive.”</p><p>Kody’s eyes opened a little wider. “Oh, I want to stay. More than anything.”</p><p>“Then help me. We can do it. Together. If you try. Try!” Vivian and Kody peered deeply into each other's eyes. Then Kody closed his eyes. Vivian continued to gaze intently down at him, to clinch him tightly with her legs, to press his face to her stomach. Kody grew still, deathly still.  </p><p>A moment later Kody's eyes fluttered open. Vivian gazed unsurely down at him. In a hoarse whisper, “Mom?”</p><p>Vivian screamed with happiness. While Kody fought to pull away from her stomach and get free of her legs. But he was too weak. So Vivian smothered him joyously with her body. “Kody! You’re back! You’re alive! KODY!”</p><p>Kody continued to squirm weakly in her legs' embrace. Hoarsely, “Mom. Stop.”</p><p>Vivian released her legs, then squirmed down beside him. She gazed at Kody laying limply in the dirt next to her. His eyes were open and he was breathing.  He was alive. She laughed like a maniac. “I can't help it, Kody. I love you so much.” Vivian looked up. The eastern sky was bright, sunlight streamed through the trees. The full moon had faded to a pale ghost of itself. </p><p>Vivian looked all around. “Hey! Mister!” The fisherman crept tentatively from out of the bushes, his gun trained on them. He was terrified. “Can you drive us to a hospital?”</p><p>The fisherman stared fearfully at her, his gun unwavering. “I called the police a while ago.” He held up a  phone. “They should be here soon. They can drive you to the hospital. I’m not getting within ten feet of you people.” Distant sirens could be heard.</p><p>Vivian sighed, with relief and exhaustion. She looked up at the eastern sky. “I was never so glad to see a sunrise in my life.” Vivian kissed Kody passionately on the lips. Kody tried to push her away, but couldn't. Finally, Vivian stopped and leaned away, smiling happily.  </p><p>While Kody spat repeatedly. “Mom!  Don't kiss me like that. That's sick.”</p><p>“Sorry. I forgot. Who you are. Now. Won't happen again.” She attempted to work  her upraised tee shirt down into a decent arrangement.</p><p>Kody wiped the blood from his lips, looking up at his mother’s bloody lips. ”Where’d all this blood come from?”</p><p>“I ripped out a man’s throat with my teeth. And bit a bat in half.”</p><p>“Yeah, right, Ozzie.”</p><p>She looked down at her stomach. “I can feel you, Armon. In there. You're still here, with us.”</p><p>“Who is Armon?”</p><p>“I'll tell you someday.”</p><p>“Is the baby okay?”</p><p>“Yes. They're both okay.”</p><p>“Both? You're having twins?”  </p><p>Vivian smiled at Kody as she considered. “Yes. You could think of it like that. Twins.”</p><p>Later that morning at a hospital Vivian, cleaned up and heavily-bandaged and wearing a hospital gown, sat at Kody's bedside. He slept peacefully beneath a sheet hooked up to an IV and a monitor. He had been cleaned up, the worst of the bites and claw-marks stitched up, the rest bandaged. Vivian, eyes closed, had one hand on the side of his face and the other hand on her stomach.</p><p>A police detective walked into the room. He nodded as Vivian opened her eyes and smiled brightly. The intensity of her smile was so disconcerting the detective had to clear his throat before speaking. “How is your son doing?”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>“And yourself?”</p><p>“I’ll live.”</p><p>“It’s amazing you are alive.”</p><p>“And my baby. My baby’s still alive. That’s amazing, too, isn’t it?”</p><p>The police detective stared curiously at her. “Yes, it is. It’s too bad your boyfriend isn’t still alive.”</p><p>Vivian's smile never faltered. “I know he's dead. I'm just so glad my son survived I can't help feeling good. My son and my baby. It'll sink in later, that Newman's dead. But right now I just keep thanking God that Kody is all right. And Harmony.”</p><p>“Harmony?”</p><p>“My baby. Harmony. That’s her name. I just named her. This morning. Harmony.”</p><p>The police detective, put off by her buoyant demeanor, looked her over closely. “You're not in shock, are you?”</p><p>Vivian laughed joyously. “No, no. I've never felt better.”</p><p>The police detective took a step back, a 'this woman is crazy' look on his face. “A lot of people died last night. Including those four at the river you killed.”</p><p>Happily, “It was self-defense. They were trying to kill me. And my son. And my baby.”</p><p>The police detective took another step back.  “The old guy fishing there said you and your son cut their hearts out.”</p><p>Vivian laughed raucously. “That’s crazy!”</p><p>The police detective backed all the way across the room to the door. “I know. Their hearts were still in their chests when we found them. There weren't even any scars on their chests.”</p><p>“Of course not! That man is insane.”</p><p>“Yes. Well, we’ll talk some more. Later. When you feel better. There’s a lot of things to sort out.”</p><p>“I feel fine now.”</p><p>The police detective lost his barely-controlled cool. “Lady, there is no way you can be feeling fine. You were full of buckshot and bullets and all chewed up. You should be dead.”</p><p>Vivian smiled insanely at him. “But I’m not. I’m alive. Kody’s alive. Harmony’s alive.\"</p><p>That did it. The police detective totally lost it. “Lady, twelve people were murdered last night. Including your boyfriend. Doesn't that bother you?”</p><p>Vivian shook her head no, smiling. “They didn't get Kody. Or my baby.” Vivian patted her stomach.  </p><p>While the police detective shook his head in resignation. “Okay. I realize you aren't in a proper frame of mind. After all you've been through. We can do this later.” The police detective abruptly walked out.  </p><p>Vivian looked back down at heavily-sedated Kody, beaming happily. From the hall the police detective turned back, frowning. “Just one more thing.” Vivian looked up, still smiling like she had lost her mind. “Why did you wait so long to bring your son to the hospital? And what were you doing with him so far out in the country?”</p><p>“We were running for our lives. People have been trying to kill us all night. I got Kody to the hospital as soon as I could.”</p><p>The police detective looked long and hard at Vivian. Then he shook his head and walked away.</p><p>Vivian relaxed back into her seat. Still smiling brightly, she continued to hold one hand to the side of Kody's face and the other to her stomach. She gazed at her stomach. “How does Harmony sound? That's a pretty name. It has Armon inside of it. Just like you. Harmony, with Armon inside. You will be so loved, Harmony.”</p><p>The police detective and another nurse stood at the nurse station watching a monitor. On the screen Vivian was seated beside Kody's bed with one hand on the side of his face and the other on her stomach, gazing down at it. Vivian's voice came from a speaker. “Kody will come to love you, too. We'll be such a happy family. Me and you and Kody and Harmony. And I feel so strong. With you inside me. Inside Harmony. No demon could ever hurt us again.”</p><p>The police detective looked to the nurse. “She's bonkers, isn't she?”</p><p>“Not at all. A lot of expectant mothers talk to their unborn babies. A loving soothing voice affects them.”</p><p>“You hear that about demons?”</p><p>“Someone went on a killing rampage last night. She says they were after her and her son and her unborn baby. I'd call them demons, too.”</p><p>“What's that about being so strong?”</p><p>“She certainly is. The ER doctor said her vital signs are off the charts. She's healthy as a horse and strong as a mule.”</p><p>“With all her wounds? How is that possible?” The nurse shrugged. “What about her baby?”</p><p>“Her obstetrician came in this morning. He says the fetus is doing okay.”</p><p>“Is she Jewish?”</p><p>“I don't think so. There is nothing in her records to indicate that.”</p><p>“That Armon she keeps raving about. I Googled it. It's a male Hebrew name. Means fortress, or stronghold. So who is Armon? Armon, inside of Harmony? She's not having twins?</p><p>“No twins.”</p><p>The bewildered police detective fell silent, contemplating the monitor screen.</p><p>Vivian sat as before, eyes closed, with one hand on her stomach and the other on Kody's face. Kody's eyes flickered open. Very hoarsely, “Mom?”</p><p>Vivian opened her eyes and gazed lovingly down at her son. “I'm right here.”</p><p>“I've been having weird dreams.”</p><p>“They're only dreams. How are you feeling?”</p><p>“Okay. Am I going to look like a freak?”</p><p>“Are you worried about scars?”</p><p>“Will they heal?”</p><p>Vivian lifted a large bandage up from the side of Kody's face. Some of the wounds were already beginning to fade. She patted the bandage back into place, then laid her hand back on top of it. “They've started healing already.”</p><p>“Good.” Kody closed his eyes.</p><p>Vivian closed her eyes also, smiling contentedly with one hand on Kody's face and the other on her stomach. Like she had been doing all morning, acting as a conduit between the demon in her baby in her womb and her son. “Love heals, Kody. It can even heal a demon.”</p>
