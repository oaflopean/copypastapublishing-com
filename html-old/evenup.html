<p>Edward Packard walked slowly up the East side of the narrow valley swinging his metal detector. A pointed four-foot long steel rod was in his other hand. He probed the ground with it wherever his metal detector made a beep.  The valley was now a cow pasture and Packard had asked permission to go treasure hunting from the farmer who owned the land.</p><p>        “You find a chest of Confederate Gold it’s mine,” the farmer laughed.</p><p>“I find a chest of Confederate Gold, you’re gonna hafta rassle it from my cold dead fingers,” Packard shot back and they both laughed.</p><p>          Edward parked his car just off the highway beside the pasture, climbed the fence and started quartering the open space.  The day was beautiful—warm and clear with a slight breeze to dry the perspiration induced by the North Georgia humidity.  Packard really was seeking civil war relics.  He didn’t expect to find any “Confederate Gold” but he had found lots of interesting things in his week-end jaunts to the local battle fields, including belt buckles, shoe nails, coins (old and new), broken bayonets and lead Minnie balls by the hundred.  His best find ever was a rusted Navy Colt pistol.  He had found that one buried under a bush on the Antietam Battle Field.  He had been forced to leave the pistol in the possession of the Antietam Historical society but his name was on a plaque beneath the pistol so he didn’t mind.</p><p>Beautiful day or not Packard had not had much luck with his detector today.  He had managed to dodge most of the cow flops that dotted the pasture and had found some cans and wire and other junk but nothing worth hanging onto. He was disappointed.  He had hoped to find something because this cow pasture loomed large in the Packard Family legend.   Great Grandfather Charles Packard had charged west across this valley to stop Federal artillery from raining shot and shell down on Joe Johnston’s army as it moved south in a desperate attempt to head off Sherman on his march toward Georgia.  Great Grandfather Packard had  ridden with the Suffolk County Volunteer Light Cavalry as they charged from the tree line on the other side of the highway.  Grandfather hadn’t made it all the way across the valley.  A little more than half way across, amid the exploding shells and flesh tearing grape shot loosed by the guns on the hill, Charlie’s horse had been shot from under him and he had crashed down, unconscious, while his comrades, though cut to bloody rags by the guns, succeeded in taking the position and spiking the guns so that Johnston’s troops could continue their futile march south. When Charlie came to his senses he managed to join up with the tail end of Johnston’s infantry and finish out the war on foot. He finished without so much as another scratch.  He lived to a hundred years old.</p><p>Edward had heard the story a hundred times from his grandfather who had heard the original story from his own father Charlie who had been the one who charged.  Edward took great pride in it and hoped it was true since he had been told that he bore a striking resemblance to old Charlie.</p><br><br><p>Charlie Packard was not a coward though he shook like a leaf in a high wind before every battle.  He usually vomited at the first sound of gunfire, but when the troop moved forward he moved with them.  Fear was a constant and well-known companion but Charlie mostly disregarded it.  He had given himself up for dead months earlier.  He had seen horrors that no human should ever see.  Friends torn to shreds by walls of screaming Minnie balls; horses blown to unrecognizable masses of guts more sickening than the piles of hog guts left from butchering; men so afraid they lost control of their most basic bodily functions, and yet they all kept going.  Officers told them to charge and they charged knowing full well that they would never survive.  Charlie knew that the only reason he was still alive was that he had a mystical appointment with death sometime in the near future.  It was inevitable.  He knew it and as he swung up onto the back of his horse to move into position to begin the charge across the valley he was sure that mystical appointment was waiting just a few moments ahead of him.</p><p>Lord God, Charlie prayed silently, if I gotta die today please let it be quick. Don’t let me just get cut in half and lay there screaming like Jimmy the other day.  And don’t let me get a leg shot off just so’s I rot to death in the hospital like Donald Cole.  If I gotta die please make it quick.</p><p>The troop moved forward at a walk, then moved up into a trot.  The lowering red sun was behind them with the glare right in the gunners eyes and that was probably why the troop was near a hundred yards into the flat of the valley before the guns opened up on them. When the first shell burst the troop drove spurs to flanks and began screaming like demented demons as the horses began to run. Dirt and grass rimmed with explosive fire burst forth like the flowers of hell in a line before the charging horses.  The men riding did not let their mounts exercise their horse sense to turn away from the punishing noise and terrifying smells, but drove them on into the chaos.</p><p>Bone rattling explosions went off all around Charlie. The concussion of the bursts threw horse and rider from side to the side; in truth Charlie no longer knew if he was charging toward the guns or not, but he drove his heels into his mount’s flanks over and over to keep the horse running. He kept his own head down, almost hugging the horse’s neck for what little protection it would give him.  He never knew what hit him when the cannon ball bounced in front of him and then flew flat, tearing into his mount’s chest and throwing Charlie high in the air.</p><br><br><p>Edward had truly hoped to find something “Civil War” in the little valley but, though he had swung his detector over a large part of the pasture, he had found nothing worth keeping.  Ah well, he thought.  Another Day.  He swung once more and brought his thumb up to flip the switch, but just as he did the beeper went off.  He flipped the switch back on but there was no answering beep.  Probably just a beer can or something, he thought but swung the detector disk around a little more.</p><p>BEEP.  A shiver went through him though the day was warm.  Goose must have stepped on my grave, he thought.</p><p>Packard moved the disk back and forth some more and soon was centered in on one particular piece of ground.  He looked down with some distaste.  The detector had centered on a pretty fresh cow flop, and besides that there was something more that bothered him about this find.  Something whispered inside his head.</p><p>“OK Eddie,” he asked himself aloud.  “How bad do you want to know what’s under the cow pie?”  It’s probably another old beer can or something, he thought again, but still jammed his pointed rod down into the middle of the manure pile.  About a six inches down his rod clinked against something hard and the feel of it sent a prickly feeling up his arm and made his breath catch.  He began to probe around it to find out how big it was and discovered it was about six inches across.   After a little he looked around to find a stick or something to help move the manure so that he could dig.</p><p>Packard used a leaf from a near-by catalpa tree to move the cow flop then pulled the small gardening spade out of his hip pocket.  He probed with his metal rod and dug with is spade and in a few minutes he had unearthed what looked like an odd shaped cannon ball.</p><p>“Hum, how ‘bout that?” he said.  The ball was crusted with dirt and rust but seemed to be in pretty good shape really.  At last he shoved his probe beneath the ball and pried it out of its hole.  He brushed as much of the dirt off as he could but it was going to take more than his hands to get the thing clean.  He turned it over and over.  It wasn’t really a cannon ball.  It looked more like a small mortar ball and holding it in his hands gave him a sort of uneasy feeling.</p><p>The sun was going down and when Packard looked up he noticed how red it seemed.  A memory of “The Red Badge of Courage” flickered through his mind, about when the tall soldier died of his wounds “…the sun stood like a red wafer in the sky.”</p><br><br><p>Something pulling at Charlie’s leg brought him awake.  His head felt cloven and he could hardly breathe because of a weight stacked on his chest.  Spears of  morning light burned his eyes. He groaned.</p><p>“Holy Shit!  This one still alive!” the young Negro slave who had been trying to pull off Charlie’s boot said.</p><p>“Well get him out of there.  Roll them bodies off him,” a white man wearing pieces of a Confederate uniform commanded.</p><p>“Yes Sir, Cap’n.  Yes Sir,” the boy said and began trying to move the corpses that had been stacked like cordwood.  Two other slaves jumped to help him after a moment.</p><p>When Charlie was free of the stack of corpses the slaves gently helped him to sit up while the white man stood beside them watching.  “Just take it easy, Massa.  You be all right.  We thought ya’ll was dead.  We’s sorry we stacked ya like that, we thought ya’ll was dead.”</p><p>“Water,” Charlie croaked.  He felt like his throat was full of grave dirt.</p><p>“Showe, Showe, Massa.”  The slave did not offer his own canteen but took the one the white man extended to him and held it to Charlie’s lips.</p><p>Charlie took a sip then grabbed the canteen from the other’s hand and drank in huge gulps.</p><p>“Best take it easy, Massa. Too much water too quick‘ll founder ya!”</p><p>The words had no more than passed the slaves lips when Charlie vomited a muddy brown mess between his legs.  Two or three more heaves and nothing but clear liquid came up and when the spasms stopped the slave handed him the canteen again.  “Just a little ‘is time, Massa.  Jus rench ya mouth out.”</p><p>         After a few more sips of water Charlie was more aware of what was going on and he said, “Y’all was tryin’ to steal my boots, wasn’t ya?  Robbin’ the dead.”</p><p>“Wasn’t stealin’ nothin’” the white man said.  “We was taking boots and anything useful to give ‘em to the living since y’all was dead and couldn’t use ‘em no more.  No need in burying perfectly good boots and coats and britches when they’s plenty of live fightin’ men havin’ to go bare foot and nigh nekkid.”</p><p>After a moments considering Charlie looked around, then up the slope where the guns had been.  They were not there any longer. “What happened?” Charlie asked.  “Did we take the guns?”</p><p>“Don’ know,” the white man said.  “Happened ‘fore we got here.”</p><p>“Uncle Joe’s boys?”</p><p>“Moved through yesterday, headed south,” the white man said.  He looked around, something anxious in his glance.  “Can you stand up?” he asked.  “We need to be movin’.  Yankee patrols all over.”</p><p>Charlie rolled himself to his hands and knees, avoiding his spew, then pushed up to a shaky stand.  He tried a step and didn’t fall down so he tried another and then another after that.  He walked toward a wagon that was piled high with boots, pieces of clothing and a few weapons.  He looked down at his waist seeking his pistol only to discover that both pistol and pistol belt were gone.</p><p>“It in the wagon, Massa.  Since you alive, you can have it back.”</p><br><br><p>The white man, whose name was Arthur Cobb, left three slaves beside the pile of dead soldiers with instructions to finish digging the mass grave.  Cobb, the young slave, and Charlie drove the loaded wagon up the highway.  After about a mile Cobb turned the mules onto a faint track that lead back into the woods and after another mile or two they came to what remained of a farm.  The house was burned to the ground as were several out buildings but the well house still stood and what looked like the sod roof of a storage cellar.</p><p>Cobb brought the wagon to the cellar door and stopped.  The three men climbed down, Packard still wobbly but better than when he was in the pile of dead men.</p><p>“You up to helpin’ us go through some of this?”  Cobb asked Packard.</p><p>“I reckon.”</p><p>“Then you get on down in the cellar.  They’s piles of boots and blouses and britches and guns.  Osiris and me’ll unload the wagon and toss it down to you an’ you toss it onto the right pile.”</p><p>Charlie nodded and stepped to the cellar door and opened it.  The door hole was dark and a sourish smell of turned earth wafted up from it and when the smell touched Charlie’s nose he began to shake.  He tried to go ahead down the ramp into the cellar but his legs would not move.  In a moment he stepped back and turned to Cobb.  “I can’t,” he said.</p><p>Cobb and the slave passed their eyes over Packard but said nothing.  At last Cobb said, “Osiris, get on down there.  We’ll toss an’ you sort.”</p><p>“Yas suh,” the young slave said and went down into the dark hole without hesitation and after a little Cobb and Packard began chucking things down the hole.  In a half-hour the wagon was empty and Cobb walked down the ramp into the cellar.  Packard took a couple of steps to follow him, but could not make his legs carry him through the door.</p><br><br><p>Late in the evening the three slaves Cobb had left behind returned.  Osiris, the young slave, had built a fire to warm some cornpone and pinto beans for all of them.  There was no foolishness about master and slave with this food.  Osiris dipped beans into tin plates and laid a hunk of cornpone on top then all the men sat around the fire to eat.</p><p>Packard noticed that the young slave kept looking at him as the night closed in around them and after a while it began to unnerve him.  “What you lookin’ at, boy?” he snapped.</p><p>Osiris dropped his eyes, “I’s sorry, Massa.”</p><p>“What was you lookin’ at?  I got something on my face or something?”</p><p>“No, Suh. T’wernt  nothin’.  I’s sorry…</p><br><br><p>Packard felt a chill that had nothing to do with the rising damp of the evening.  “What did you see, boy?”  He demanded.  “Tell me!”</p><p>“Go ‘head and tell him, Osiris,” Cobb commanded.  “We can all see it.”</p><p>“Yas Suh,” the young slave said.  “Massa Charlie, they’s a light about you that ain’t natural.”</p><p>“A light?  What kinda light?”</p><p>“Corpse light,” Cobb said, “like the glow comes from a corpse sometimes, after it been laying out a couple days.  Like the way fox fire glows on an old stump.”</p><p>Packard looked from face to face thinking they were just trying to scare him, but in neither black faces nor white did he see any hint that this was a joke or a ghost story.</p><p>“Massa Charlie,” Osiris went on.  “I b’lieve you s’pose to be dead, but you ain’t.  I b’lieve Massa Death made a mistake and didn’ take you when he was s’pose to.”</p><p>Packard blinked then shook his head in angry dismissal.  “I’m alive an’ all that other is just nigger superstition,” he said, but not too convincingly.</p><p>“Yas Suh, if you says so, but soon or late Massa Death, he gonna count up an when he do he gonna notice you missin’, and he gonna even things up.”</p><br><br><p>Ed took the strange looking shell home and put it in the garage, away from prying eyes.  He did a quick Internet search and found that the shell was indeed from a small mortar, called a “kettle gun.”  Their shells were among the first to have impact detonators and had only been in limited use because they were unpredictable and as likely to explode in the hands of the man servicing the gun as on impact.</p><p>“Hum,” Packard said to himself turning the shell over in his hands. “No way it’s still live.”  He placed the shell on his work bench and turned to get a gallon can of paint thinner to clean the rust from it.  He didn’t notice the shell roll off the bench and fall toward the floor.</p><br><br><p>END</p>
