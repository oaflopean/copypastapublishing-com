 <p>﻿“We have a stable orbit around Astraeus.” said the pilot.</p>  <p>The woman who was sitting behind the pilot managed to keep her sigh of relief inside her chest. Neither the pilot nor the man next to him knew that she had been gripping her chair all that time and, as far as she was concerned, they didn’t need to know. The whole experience of being in space made her feel very nervous, and she still hadn’t gotten used to being weightless.</p>  <p>“What do you think they’re saying on the news about us?” asked the man next to the pilot.</p>  <p>Nobody answered.</p>  <p>“Three brave astronauts have departed on the first ever manned mission outside the solar system.” he continued with a dramatic tone. “The crew, a fine example of international cooperation, is composed of American pilot Aaron Goode, Chinese surgeon Mei-Xiu Ru”—he looked at the other passengers with a grin— “And last but not least, Russian nuclear engineer Vlad Ozerov,” he said, pointing towards himself.</p>  <p>“If they knew what we’re really going to do,” said Aaron, “They wouldn’t be so cheery.”</p>  <p>“It’s all a political scheme, anyway.” said Vlad. “Why do you think they put the American in charge?”</p>  <p>“Because NASA owns the ship.” retorted Aaron.</p>  <p>“Come on, Goode, open your eyes. The Russian government put me here because they don’t trust you. The Chinese government did the same with Miss Ru, it’s not like we’re going to need a surgeon.”</p>  <p>“Let’s hope we don’t.” said Mei.</p>  <p>From where she was, Mei could see both of their faces. Aaron had a broad jawline and small, yet determined, brown eyes. Although they were both physically fit, Vlad was the more muscular of the two. In contrast with Aaron, Vlad had playful, green eyes and a black beard. Mindlessly stroking her silky, black hair, she thought about the teambuilding exercises they had to endure on Earth. In her opinion, those things never worked.</p>  <p>They sat for a few hours in their seats, as the spacecraft completed a full orbit around Astraeus. The surface of the planet was covered in a thick layer of darkness, but Mei still tried to discern some major landmarks. She saw a few mountain ranges poke through the night, but nothing seemed remarkable. Astraeus also had vast oceans of ice, which she could barely make out from that height. A few times she thought she saw orange spots light up on the surface and then die out after a few minutes, but she couldn’t have said for certain what they were. </p>  <p>After one orbit was completed, Aaron said pointing to a screen:</p>  <p>“I’ve computed a map of the planet. The best landing site is here. The bombsite is about 100 kilometres to the east, close to the coast.”</p>  <p>“Explain to me again, Goode, how does this whole thing work?” asked Vlad. “Why can’t we just plant the bomb anywhere and get out of here?”</p>  <p>“We need to plant the bomb so that the debris from the explosion will be diverted away from Earth.” said Aaron. “Otherwise, we’d be hit by many small rocks instead of one big rock. My question to you is why we couldn’t just nuke it from Earth?”</p>  <p>“Because,” said Vlad, “A nuke doesn’t have enough power to destroy a planet. As you know, we’re carrying an antimatter bomb that myself and other engineers have built.”</p>  <p>“Which, unfortunately, needs to be armed on-site.”</p>  <p>“Which is where I come in.” said Vlad. “And you need to make sure the math works out. Alright, alright, that’s clever. But it won’t hit us for a few decades. Why now, why couldn’t it wait?”</p>  <p>“We have a short time until it falls into the Sun’s gravitational well and we won’t be able to divert it anymore.” said Aaron.</p>  <p>Vlad clicked his lips and stroked his beard.</p>  <p>“What about the gas giants?” he said. “They’ve always protected us from comets and asteroids. Why not now?”</p>  <p>“NASA calculated the trajectories. Astraeus is on its course for impact.”</p>  <p>Mei kept quiet until Vlad stopped asking questions. She didn’t understand all that Aaron explained, but she finally knew that the Earth was at stake. A knot formed in her throat at the realization of what was resting upon the crew’s shoulders. That was the first time they talked about their objective, and back on Earth they had been told only what they strictly needed to know. Which, in Mei’s case of being the surgeon, meant almost nothing. She guessed that sending such a powerful bomb into space made the world’s governments uneasy and they didn’t want to seed more distrust than there already was.</p>  <p>“Size and mass similar to Earth.” said Aaron. “Surface made out of rock and ice. Atmosphere is breathable. High winds, but no sign of precipitation. Average surface temperature is -70 degrees Celsius, or -94 Fahrenheit. That’s awfully warm.”</p>  <p>“Doesn’t sound like the beach to me.” said Vlad.</p>  <p>“This is a planet that’s been knocked out of its orbit.” said Aaron. “It’s been travelling through deep space with no source of heat. The atmosphere itself should have frozen.”</p>  <p>Aaron tapped a few more buttons.</p>  <p>“Time to land.” he said. “Detaching from the orbital module.”</p>  <p>The spacecraft rattled once and then began drifting forward. On the screen, they could see the orbital module following from behind. Aaron fired the thrusters on low throttle, putting some distance between the lander and the orbital module.</p>  <p>“Don’t forget where we parked.” said Vlad.</p>  <p>Aaron pulled at the controls and the lander began spinning backwards. Mei expected her stomach to turn upside down, but then remembered that there was no up and down in space. She was thankful to sit behind the men, as she didn’t know if her face betrayed what she was going through.</p>  <p>The lander was now travelling backwards. Aaron turned the thrusters on again and they started slowing down, getting closer to the planet. Above, they saw the orbital module rush past them. The lander shook as it entered the atmosphere. Below them, the grey surface of Astraeus was fast approaching. High mountain peaks and frozen ocean shores were forming at the horizon and then quickly disappearing out of sight, as they were falling towards the planet.</p>  <p>“Deploying parachute.” said Aaron.</p>  <p>As soon as the parachute opened, Mei felt a crushing sensation as her momentum was pressing her against the seat. The lander slowed down and began descending vertically, all the shaking having stopped. They were on their backs, unable to see the planet surface from that position. Mei could now feel the comforting pull of gravity. The lander trembled one more time, as its legs hit the ground softly, propping themselves on the rocky surface.</p>  <p>“Thank you for flying with Goode airlines.” said Vlad.</p>  <p>Aaron reeled the parachute back in. He made the last system checks and turned on the external spotlight. They all got out of their seats, put on their thermal gear and went outside. They were on a flat plateau, with mountains profiling against the sky far to the north and west. The ground was mostly covered in ice, with the occasional patch of rock sticking out from underneath.</p>  <p>Eternal darkness slept over the frozen surface of Astraeus. A barren world of ice and rock stood hostile before them. The intruding lights coming from the lander disturbed the ancient inaction cast upon the planet eons ago. Mei marvelled at the landscape before her but couldn’t help feeling unwanted. Astraeus was a display of both the greatness and the cruelty of the universe.</p>  <p>“Sure doesn’t look like the beach.” said Vlad. “Why is it so dark?”</p>  <p>“Because we’re too far away from any star.” said Aaron. “This planet hasn’t seen daylight in a long time.”</p>  <p>Vlad kicked some rocks and watched them roll away.</p>  <p>“Imagine that, a sky without a sun.”</p>  <p>The wind howled empty in the distant mountains.</p>  <p>“Yeah, but then we’d miss out on this.” said Aaron pointing upwards.</p>  <p>The black expanse of space covered them like a veil and sprayed all over it were myriads of stars, too many to count in one lifetime. The stars flickered vaguely in a rhythmic chaos, telling them stories of the past that they could not comprehend.</p>  <p>“Get your flag, Goode,” said Vlad, “I know how much you Americans like to stick it everywhere you go.”</p>  <p>“Let’s not waste time.” said Aaron with a frown. “Now’s as good a time as ever to get going.”</p>  <p>With that, Aaron and Vlad went to the lander. They lowered the rover and loaded it with supplies for the road. Vlad carefully secured the bomb in its place. Mei watched them for a while and then crept away.</p>  <p>She took a few steps towards the shadowy peaks, listening to the ice crunch under her boots. Before she knew it, she had gotten quite far from the lander, but she could still see the spotlight. She looked upon the alien landscape, trying to take in that new world she was now an inhabitant of. Mei never thought she’d find beauty in desolation. It was not a pleasant beauty, like she’d see on Earth, but a rough and unforgiving one.</p>  <p>With a gloved hand, Mei picked up a few rocks from the ground and examined them. Most of them were, if Mei had to guess, of volcanic origin, from the planet’s younger years. Some of them looked sedimentary, from when the liquid water hadn’t yet frozen. Geology had been her interest since an early age, perhaps more so than medicine. It was comforting to know that the same geological patterns applied on Astraeus, as they did on Earth.</p>  <p>Mei had looked at the map and had seen no valleys that could have carried large rivers, so all the water would have been gathered in streams, lakes and oceans. And because the soil had the same rocky composition everywhere, there was no chance of anything growing on Astraeus.</p>  <p>One of the rocks caught her eye. She picked it up. It was white and strangely shaped. She rubbed the edges with her thumb and part of the rock crumbled away.</p>  <p>“I can’t believe it.” muttered Mei. “It’s a bone fragment.”</p>  <p>Suddenly, she heard a roar behind her. She turned around and saw a beast twice as large as her. To Mei, it looked a lot like a bear, but with a bigger body and smaller head. It was covered in long, white fur and its brown, pearl-shaped eyes and mouth were barely visible. A flat nose was sniffing the air. It had four short, stumpy legs and its front paws had blood stained nails.</p>  <p>The beast roared again. Mei felt her legs freeze. All she could do was scream, hoping that her crewmates would hear. The beast slowly walked towards her. She couldn’t take her eyes off the creature. She screamed again, even louder. The beast stood up on its hind legs and raised one of its paws. Mei covered her face with her arms. The claw hit her, ripping through her gear.</p>  <p>Mei stumbled and fell to the ground. She saw the lander in the distance, taunting her with its light. She got up on her feet and ran towards it, but before she could take too many steps, something wrapped around her neck. It was wet, warm and sticky. She dug her fingers in it, trying to get it off, but it wrapped itself even tighter. Mei fell on her back, being pulled towards the beast. She looked behind her and could hardly believe her own eyes. The beast’s tongue was wrapped around her. The creature was now towering over her on its hind legs, pulling her towards it, waiting to rip her apart with its claws. She tried to scream, but couldn’t breathe in.</p>  <p>She saw two small lights approaching her from the lander. It was the rover, with its headlights turned on. The rover came from the side and rammed into the beast. The creature let go of Mei and rolled a few metres away. On all fours, it stared at its opponents for a few moments, let out another roar and lazily turned away and left.</p>  <p>Aaron got out of the rover. Vlad was running towards them from the lander. Aaron pulled Mei up.</p>  <p>“Are you ok?” he asked.</p>  <p>“I’m fine.”</p>  <p>She tried not to shake. She tried not to cry. She didn’t know if Aaron and Vlad could tell how terrified she had been.</p>  <p>“That was reckless, Goode.” whispered Vlad.</p>  <p>“The rover isn’t damaged from the impact.” said Aaron.</p>  <p>Aaron faced Mei again, stretching his arms out towards her.</p>  <p>“Are you sure you’re ok?”</p>  <p>“I’m fine,” said Mei pulling away from Aaron.</p>  <p>After they finished packing, they got in the rover. Aaron was in the driver’s seat and Vlad was next to him, while Mei was on the backseat.</p>  <p>“This world isn’t as dead as we thought.” said Aaron. “We need to be more cautious from now on.”</p>  <p>They turned on the headlights, left the lander behind and made their way through the frozen terrain. They travelled in silence for a few hours, everyone looking out the windows at the barren wasteland that was Astraeus. The rover made its way forward slowly, Aaron having to carefully navigate between the rocky outcrops.</p>  <p>After a few hours had passed, Aaron stopped the rover and the crew got out and set up their camp. They couldn’t see the mountains anymore, being in the middle of a large plateau that they knew from the map to extend all the way to the eastern shore. They got in their sleeping bags, trying desperately to warm up, each of them opening a bag of military rations.</p>  <p>“These sausages do not taste like meat.” said Vlad. “What do you have?”</p>  <p>“Let’s see,” said Aaron, “Soft, slimy pasta and dry peanut butter crackers.” </p>  <p>“What about you, Miss Ru?” said Vlad.</p>  <p>“I have stew.” said Mei without taking her eyes off her food.</p>  <p>“What kind?” prompted Vlad.</p>  <p>“Either beef or bean, I’m not entirely sure.” said Mei with a chuckle.</p>  <p>Vlad burst into laughter, his playful eyes watching Mei with sympathy. They continued eating in silence for a few minutes, Mei focusing on the sound of clinking cutlery in order to ignore the blandness as much as she could. Aaron was the first to speak:</p>  <p>“Do you have any family, Ozerov?”</p>  <p>“I have three sisters and two brothers back in Russia, all with children of their own, some even with grandchildren.”</p>  <p>“I imagine you must visit them quite often. Family gatherings must be interesting with so many people.”</p>  <p>Vlad looked down at his oddly looking peach jam.</p>  <p>“Yeah, that’s kind of how it goes.” he said stirring the jam with his spoon.</p>  <p>Aaron, after taking a sip of water, turned towards Mei:</p>  <p>“What about you, Mei?”</p>  <p>Mei coughed, pretending to choke on her food, trying to delay answering the question for as long as possible. When she couldn’t come up with any good lie, she placed her hands under the cover and started nervously playing with her fingers.</p>  <p>“My parents live in Shanghai.” she said, Aaron encouraging her with silent nods, “But we don’t speak that often. We don’t speak…at all.”</p>  <p>“Why not?” asked Aaron.</p>  <p>Mei glanced in Vlad’s direction, who was also listening closely.</p>  <p>“We’ve never been on good terms.” she said. “They pushed me throughout my studies, I owe me being a surgeon entirely to them. But they weren’t there for anything else. After I graduated I decided to stop talking to them.”</p>  <p>“I’m sorry to hear that.” said Aaron, as Vlad sighed.</p>  <p>“What about your family, Aaron?”</p>  <p>Aaron tidied up the packaging left from his food, before lying down in his sleeping bag.</p>  <p>“I’m quite close to my parents.” he said. “My dad was a pilot and he had a big collection of model airplanes that him and I would fly in his spare time. His hobby rubbed off onto me and inspired me to become a pilot, just like him.”</p>  <p>“They must be proud of you.” said Mei.</p>  <p>“They are. We need to get some sleep. In eight hours, we’ll be on our way.”</p>  <p>Having said that, Aaron turned on his side, facing away from Mei, and didn’t speak another word. In a few minutes, Mei heard him breathing heavily, meaning that he’d fallen asleep. Vlad, who Mei guessed had been waiting for Aaron to fall asleep, turned to face her and said:</p>  <p>“Are you sure you’re alright? Earlier, with that thing that attacked you, it must have been scary.”</p>  <p>When the animal had attacked her, she would have had time to run, but she had been too scared to move. She’d put her crewmates in danger and had forced Aaron to risk the rover to save her. Within minutes after their landing, she’d already proven how much of a burden she was to the team.</p>  <p>“I don’t think I’m the most qualified person to be here.” she answered.</p>  <p>“Don’t say that, Miss Ru, none of us has any idea what we’re doing. We’re all basically strangers, I’d be surprised if we had it all figured out.”</p>  <p>Mei forced herself to smile, playing with her fingers under the cover once again.</p>  <p>“I’m scared.” she said.</p>  <p>Vlad propped himself up in one elbow and looked at her with raised eyebrows.</p>  <p>“So am I. And I bet cowboy Goode is too.”</p>  <p>“You don’t show it.”</p>  <p>“There are a lot of things I don’t show. Sweet dreams, Miss Ru.”</p>  <p>Vlad rolled on his side, hiding his face under the cover and started snoring in a suspiciously short time. Mei laid down, her mind busily going through everything that could go wrong with the mission. She thought she’d be unable to fall asleep, but in a few minutes her tiredness took over and she fell into a dreamless slumber.</p>  <p>She woke up after Aaron and Vlad, as they were still in their sleeping bags sipping watery coffee. Trying not to fall asleep again, she chased away the gloom that the never-ending night had imprinted on her. She had a headache which was making her dizzy and her body was shivering with cold and lethargy.</p>  <p>“No exactly a five-star hotel,” said Vlad as Mei was eating some crackers, “But at least we get breakfast in bed.”</p>  <p>After they got out of their sleeping bags, they packed everything back into the rover and drove on. Aaron was quiet, speaking only when necessary and answering in short sentences. Mei could tell that something was on his mind, but she couldn’t muster the courage to ask what it was. Even Vlad, after a few attempted jokes which seemed to irritate Aaron, stopped talking unless necessary. He had placed a keychain of a woman in a red, floral dress around the rear-view mirror, saying: “This is Matryoshka. Goode could use the company of a lady like her.”</p>  <p>They travelled for ten hours, with only a few breaks in which they stretched and ate. Once, Vlad suggested that Aaron should nap, but the pilot dismissed him without a word, simply driving onwards.</p>  <p>When they eventually did stop, the astronauts placed their sleeping bags on the ground and got under the covers. They ate their rations in silence and, after they had finished, Aaron stood up and dragged his feet in Mei’s direction.</p>  <p>“Come walk with me.” he said, to Mei’s surprise.</p>  <p>Mei reluctantly got out of her sleeping bag, the cold creeping back in her bones as soon as she did, and the two of them left the camp and walked away into the shadowy plateau. Soon, they could no longer see the rover, which sent a sense of dread through Mei’s spine.</p>  <p>“I noticed you’re uncomfortable around us.” said Aaron.</p>  <p>His face was turned towards her, but Mei found comfort in not being able to see his eyes.</p>  <p>“You and Vlad are uncomfortable around each other.”</p>  <p>Aaron looked away, leaving Mei to imagine the tense expression on his face.</p>  <p>“I’m not going to lie to you, Mei, I don’t like his attitude. With all his quips and flippant comments, I’m sure he’s taking me in his stride.”</p>  <p>Mei didn’t know how to reply, which made her feel uneasy. They kept walking in silence, until Aaron stopped and looked at the sky.</p>  <p>“Do you see that star?” he said, pointing upwards.</p>  <p>Mei looked in the direction he was pointing and saw a tiny spot of light, completely alike all the others.</p>  <p>“It’s the Sun.” said Aaron.</p>  <p>“It’s so small, kind of puts your whole life into perspective, doesn’t it?”</p>  <p>Aaron turned his face towards her once again and looked into her eyes. She could distinguish his features now, her eyes having gotten used to being in the dark, but it didn’t make her feel uncomfortable anymore.</p>  <p>“Actually,” he said, “I think distance has a way of making important things seem small and insignificant.”</p>  <p>Mei smiled at him, as he placed his hands on her shoulders.</p>  <p>They kept walking for a few more minutes, when suddenly Mei felt the dirt disappear from under her feet. She fell on her back and slid along the rocks, until she crashed against horizontal ground. She stood up, struggling to keep her balance. She had fallen into a ditch, barely taller than herself, with steep gravel walls.</p>  <p>“I’m ok, I’m just bruised.” she said.</p>  <p>Aaron jumped into the ditch from where he was standing on the edge and, as he hit the bottom, his boots made a splashing sound. They looked at each other, before kneeling and looking at the shallow puddle of water that was in front of them.</p>  <p>“It can’t be.” said Mei. “How can there be liquid water on this ball of ice?”</p>  <p>Aaron took off his glove and dipped his finger in the water, only to pull it out instantly.</p>  <p>“It’s hot,” he said, “Probably above 50 degrees Celsius.”</p>  <p>As they stood up, a red flash brightened their surroundings for a brief moment. Before they could realize what had happened, a booming uproar hit their ears, as the ground underneath them started trembling. Far towards the north, against the lit-up horizon, they could see a mountain pouring its burning bowels onto its sides. Pillars of fire rose like javelins from the planet’s core, attacking the black sky and coughing smoke into the clear expanse above. Astraeus seemed to exhale through its crust, like a giant from the pages of an old story, awakened fleetingly from its eternal slumber.</p>  <p>Mei and Aaron watched the dreadful display, until the quaking stopped, and the mountain ceased its assault upon the heavens. The mountain was still smouldering, and lava was flowing down its slopes, but the giant’s anger seemed to have been replaced by hateful suppression.</p>  <p>“Volcanoes,” whispered Mei. “I’ve seen them from orbit, like hundreds of orange dots.”</p>  <p>“That explains why the planet is so warm. The geologic activity must be high enough to keep the temperature as it is.”</p>  <p>Mei and Aaron climbed out of the ditch and started heading towards the rover. They had walked about a hundred metres, by Mei’s approximation, when they heard another rumble from the north. It couldn’t have been another earthquake, because it sounded like something was coming towards them.</p>  <p>Out of the shadows, creatures came running in their direction, having been scared by the volcanic eruption. Aaron pulled Mei down and the two astronauts crouched covering their heads, while the animals rushed past them on either side, running from the source of their fright.</p>  <p>When the stampede was over, Mei and Aaron stood up and looked around them, only to notice they were face to face with one of the animals that had fallen behind. Only then, Mei was able to get a better look and see what those creatures were like. Similar to the animal she had seen before, this one also had long, white fur which hid its long body, legs, neck and most of its face. Its raging eyes were visible through the fur, and between the eyes, covering most of the face, was a skeletal shield. To Mei, the bone or carapace looked like it would be used for attack, just like a rhino would use its horn. Underneath the shield was a strong, wide lower jaw, with short teeth, which resembled that of a hippo.</p>  <p>Aaron yanked Mei by the arm and the two dashed in the opposite direction from the animal. Mei heard the four stumpy legs bash against the ice, as the beast pursued them. The astronauts, being faster, were far ahead of the animal. Mei was scouting the horizon, desperately trying to find the rover lights, hoping that such brightness might scare the animal away. She could still hear it behind them, galloping unrelentingly. </p>  <p>She couldn’t find the lights, wishing they hadn’t walked so far away. Glancing in Aaron’s direction, who was running beside her, she saw that he was just as worried as her. They were getting tired. Mei’s legs were burning, and her lungs were gasping for the painfully cold air. She could hear the thumping drawing closer with each passing moment, no matter how hard she pushed herself to run faster.</p>  <p>Suddenly, Aaron turned right, running away from Mei. She tried to veer sharply, but her legs fumbled, and she fell to her knees. She looked back at the animal that had decided to make Aaron its target. Mei watched helplessly as Aaron was running in zig-zag trying unsuccessfully to confuse the animal, until she heard footsteps approaching. Turning around, she saw Vlad’s silhouette run towards her, waving his arms above his head. She looked back in Aaron’s direction, just as the beast charged with its head ready for impact. Aaron jumped out of the way, rolling to the side, as the animal slid on the ice, stopping its charge. The creature turned around and, seeing Mei and Vlad, decided to storm towards them.</p>  <p>Aaron rushed in their direction, but the animal, in its mad frenzy, was running faster than him. Vlad had pulled Mei on her feet, but she was stuck in place, paralysed with fear. All she could do was watch the skeletal shield that was on its way to ram into her. In the corner of her eye, she saw Vlad pick up a sharp rock from the ground and run towards the animal. He was sprinting at full speed towards the incoming carapace, his feet sending ice crystals flying behind him. Mei tried to shout at him, she tried to run and push him out of the way, but she could only extend her arm towards him. Vlad swung the rock to the side and brought it forward with all his strength, impaling it in the creature’s eye. Filled with pain and rage, the beast shook its head left and right, hitting Vlad with its massive armour and throwing him to the ground. Stomping, the animal would have soon trampled Vlad.</p>  <p>Mei’s world started spinning and she could feel the rations agitating in her stomach, as she ran towards Vlad. When she got close to him, she extended her arms to grab him and pull him away, but she tripped again and fell on the ice. She was right under the beast’s legs, as it was still stomping, trying to get the rock out of its eye.</p>  <p>Out of nowhere, Aaron jumped on the beast’s back, gripping the long fur with his hands. The animal, feeling the new attacker, shook its body, but Aaron dug his fingers in its skin as tight as he could and held himself in place. In blind fury, the creature ran in circles, desperately trying to rid itself of the parasite clinging to its back. Mei and Vlad stood up and put a good distance between themselves and the raging animal. Mei could just imagine Aaron falling and being crushed under the animal’s legs and wanted to scream at her helplessness.</p>  <p>With one hand, Aaron grabbed the rock that was still in the animal’s eye and twisted it inside the wound. The creature shook its body one more time, sending Aaron flying off its back. He fell on the ice, as the animal dashed past him, narrowly avoiding being flattened. The animal, scared and wounded, ran off into the distance, abandoning its prey.</p>  <p>Mei, unable to stop herself from shaking, felt Vlad’s hand on her shoulder.</p>  <p>“Are you alright?” he asked.</p>  <p>“I froze again.” she mumbled. “Thank you for saving me.”</p>  <p>“Don’t mention it, Miss Ru.”</p>  <p>Aaron had made his way towards them, looking at Mei from head to toe, making sure she was unharmed.</p>  <p>“Is everyone ok?” he asked.</p>  <p>“Don’t worry about me.” said Vlad, holding an arm wrapped around his abdomen. “I’m not the one who thinks he’s in an action film. Cowboy Goode saves the Earth, but you forgot your cape and your white hat that goes on your overgrown head.”</p>  <p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>  <p>Both men, exhausted and in pain, were barely standing on their feet, yet neither of them wore it on their faces.</p>  <p>“We know that this place is dangerous, Goode, but you still decided to go for a walk. You almost got our surgeon killed. You almost got yourself killed, thinking you were at the rodeo. Not that I care, but you’re the only one who’s been trained to drive the rover. Without you, I can’t make it to the bombsite.”</p>  <p>Aaron looked away, his lips twitching, but remaining shut. Vlad turned around and walked towards the rover, with Mei beside him and Aaron a few steps behind.</p>  <p>“Those rations must’ve given you a really upset stomach, Goode.” shouted Vlad over his shoulder. “From where I was, it sounded almost like a volcanic eruption.”</p>  <p>They reached the rover and went to sleep without another word and woke up eight hours afterwards.</p>  <p>After packing everything in the rover, Aaron got in the driver’s seat, as usual, but Vlad sat on the backseat, next to Mei. The lack of sunlight was visibly taking its toll on all of them, adding to the stress they were already under. Mei had her face buried in her hands for most of the journey, only lifting her head to occasionally look out the window.</p>  <p>The wind was faster than it had been before, due to the convection currents caused by the volcanic eruption. A thin filter of charcoal covered the sky, partially blocking the starlight from reaching the ground. After a while, the wind picked up, throwing ash and ice at the windshield, with the noise resonating inside the rover.</p>  <p>“Goode, we have to stop.” said Vlad.</p>  <p>“Just a little farther.” said Aaron looking at Vlad over his shoulder. “We’ll make it to the bombsite soon and we’ll get some cover there.”</p>  <p>“Goode, it might get worse soon. Let’s stop now and wait for the storm to pass.”</p>  <p>“We’re safe in the rover, Ozerov,” said Aaron.</p>  <p>Vlad pushed his back against the seat, squeezing his hands into fists. Aaron pretended to ignore the reaction, but Mei could see him tighten his grip around the steering wheel. She tried to think of something to say to defuse the situation, perhaps come up with a bad joke like Vlad often did. She glanced at Vlad, who gave her a meaningful look, his fists still clenched. She hoped that Aaron hadn’t seen the brief exchange, as she didn’t want to pick sides. Both of them were right in their own way, both of them had valid points that they were trying to get across, but neither of them was willing to listen to the other one.</p>  <p>A gust of wind hit the rover, and its front lifted off the ground. Aaron twisted the steering wheel left and right, trying to grip onto something, with no result. The vehicle slowly tipped to one side, before completely falling over. Mei’s brains shook inside her head until the rover was done rolling, having stopped upside down.</p>  <p>“I sure feel safe in the rover right now.” said Vlad. </p>  <p>The astronauts unbuckled their seatbelts and crawled out of the vehicle, into the snowstorm. They were holding their arms in front of their faces, trying to protect themselves from the wind. Mei was holding onto the frame of the vehicle, afraid that she’d get blown over by the gale.</p>  <p>“What now, Goode?” asked Vlad.</p>  <p>Aaron faced Vlad with his fists clenched, standing straight despite the storm. </p>  <p>“You’d best stop undermining my authority, Ozerov. Otherwise we might have a problem.”</p>  <p>Vlad walked slowly towards Aaron and got within a few centimetres of his face, looking him straight in the eyes. Aaron’s expression was unwavering, as if someone had sculpted his features out of marble. In contrast, Vlad looked impish and defiant, with a vague trace of a smile on his lips. </p>  <p>“Then you’d best start being a leader, Goode.”</p>  <p>Aaron didn’t back away, although their faces were almost touching. Mei saw how tense both of them looked, and knew they were ready to jump at each other’s throats at the slightest provocation. After a few moments of staring, Aaron finally said:</p>  <p>“Your opinion is noted.”</p>  <p>Mei opened her mouth to suggest they try to flip the rover on its wheels, but before she could say anything, they heard howls coming from all around them. Aaron and Vlad backed away from each other and the three astronauts paused, listening to the roaring wind. They heard the howls once again, closer, seemingly just outside the beams cast by the rover’s headlights.</p>  <p>“Let’s flip the rover.” said Aaron.</p>  <p>The astronauts pushed against the rover with all their strength, but the vehicle didn’t budge. When they heard a third howl, they stopped and got close to each other, with their backs pressed against the vehicle.</p>  <p>Coming into view one by one, a pack of animals formed a circle around them, keeping their distance from the headlights. Indicative of the extinction that had taken place when Astraeus was thrown out of orbit, these animals exhibited similar characteristics to the previous ones the astronauts had encountered. The white fur, small eyes and lack of other visible features were identical to what they had seen before. However, these animals were slenderer and had more definition along their bodies and four legs. If they stood on their hind legs, although they didn’t seem to be able to, they would have been as tall as a human of average height. Each of them also had a wide, open mouth, with teeth like a shark, pieces of raw meat hanging between them, ready to rip into the astronauts. The growling animals examined their prey, muscles twitching and saliva dripping from their mouths.</p>  <p>One of them dashed towards the astronauts at high speed. Aaron raised his arms and let out of his chest a loud shriek, prompting the beast to abandon its attack, turn around and run away into the darkness. The other animals watched it desert, but this display was not enough to deter them. The creatures started closing in on them, one step at a time, gnawing impatiently at the air. Mei’s knees were shaking, and she had forgotten all about the cold and exhaustion. She looked at Aaron and Vlad, waiting for one of them to do something that would get them out of there. But all the two men did was watch as the beasts drew nearer.</p>  <p>Fear had made Mei’s heart sink into her stomach, as she thought about her impending death. Unlike before, however, that fear did not translate into paralysis, but into absolute clarity, as the will to survive took root in her mind. Mei turned on her heels and, with two leaps, made her way to the back of the rover. She opened the trunk and all the contents fell on the ground. She searched among them, hands shaking, until she found what she was looking for: flares. She picked up as many as she could and handed a few to Aaron and Vlad. Each of the astronauts lit a flare and began waving them and making loud noises.</p>  <p>Witnessing this, the animals took a few steps back, as the light from the flares reflected in their black eyes. When Aaron’s flare was almost spent, he threw it at the animals’ feet before lighting another one. The creatures drew away from it and froze in place watching it, neither approaching, nor running away. Eventually, one of them walked next to the flare, sniffed it and pushed it with its paw, rolling it away. They had seen that the light was harmless and were now drawing closer to the astronauts once more.</p>  <p>“That was a great idea, Mei.” said Aaron genuinely.</p>  <p>“Miss Ru has had it in her all along.” replied Vlad.</p>  <p>Mei ignored their compliments, waving the flare in front of her, still trying to scare off the animals. A wild cry came from the darkness, causing the animals and the astronauts to stop and listen. Mei, expecting the worst from this new opponent, saw her crewmates get ready for a fight. Another group of creatures appeared from the shadows, but these ones were nothing like they had seen before.</p>  <p>These creatures were walking on two legs and were wearing leather boots and coats that reached down to their knees, with hoods that protected their heads. Although they varied in height, most of them were as tall as Aaron or Vlad. Their faces were covered in long fur, in shades of white, black, grey and brown, and some of them had braided strands of hair and wore various stones as decoration. Two small eyes and a dog-like nose were visible through the hair, as well as dark lips similar to those of a monkey. Many of them carried nets full of fish in their arms, but some were equipped with rope darts with heads made out of stone.</p>  <p>With another battle cry, the armed ones positioned themselves between the astronauts and the beasts. Extremely skilled with the rope darts, they swung them in the direction of the creatures, maiming some and frightening others, until all of them scurried away, leaving behind the few of their pack that had been killed.</p>  <p>Mei had watched the fight in amazement, without even noticing that she was still holding an extinguished flare. The other natives had placed their nets on the ground and they had all gathered around the astronauts, speaking to one another in a language of growls and grunts.</p>  <p>“Thank you.” said Aaron, extending his hand.</p>  <p>The natives stopped talking and looked at Aaron, who had lowered his hand after none of the newcomers took it.</p>  <p>“We’re humans, we’re from planet Earth.”</p>  <p>“Spot on, Goode, I think they know exactly what you mean.” said Vlad.</p>  <p>Aaron gave Vlad an angry glance and then looked back at the natives, forcing a smile on his face.</p>  <p>“We’re having some trouble with our vehicle.” he said pointing towards the rover. “Do you think you can give us a hand?”</p>  <p>The natives barked a few words at each other, and then tied their ropes around the rover. The three astronauts, with the help of the natives, managed to flip the rover on its wheels. Aaron thanked them again, but none of them acknowledged it in any way. Instead, with a grunt, one of the natives waved his arm, signalling that he wanted the astronauts to follow them. The three got back in their spots in the rover and Aaron drove slowly, following the group of natives to wherever they were going.</p>  <p>After a few minutes of driving, the guides led the astronauts into a small settlement. A few huts, made out of stones piled on top of one another, were spread across an area of no more than a few hundred square metres. The huts were circular and had round, flattened roofs and a small hole, serving as entrance, through which a person couldn’t walk without hunching over. The houses, with shapes which reminded Mei of beehives, had been placed in no particular pattern and were facing in random directions. As they drove between the huts, many natives ran out of the way, shielding their eyes from the headlights.</p>  <p>After Aaron parked the rover just outside the village, the three astronauts wandered around the area on foot. Black algae had been spread on the ground in places, left to dry in the wind. Women sat in front of their houses weaving ropes and fishing nets out of animal fur and glancing suspiciously at the astronauts as they walked by. Fires crackled here and there with low flame, the smell of the burning algae being like that of a wild seashore on Earth. Four-legged animals, some of them with long fur and others freshly shorn, were lazily walking around the village, eating from piles of fish that had been left for them on the ground. These animals had strong jaws, with pointy teeth, and ram-like horns, but were entirely domesticated. And behind a stone fence were crab-like creatures which made clicking noises. Besides their four legs, the only distinguishable feature they had were the two fleshy tentacles that came from underneath their carapaces and wrapped gently around every object they touched.</p>  <p>The astronauts walked into a central area, in front of a large, long house. As soon as they got there, the natives seemed to congregate around them, blocking off every path out of the area.</p>  <p>“Goode, this is the bombsite. Right here.” whispered Vlad.</p>  <p>“Not now.”</p>  <p>The natives stood and stared at them, talking to each other in muffled grunts. Mei’s mind raced to what they could have been saying. Did they see the astronauts as a threat, were they trying to figure out how to dispose of those strange, hairless creatures? Careful not to make any sudden movements, Aaron waved at the natives.</p>  <p>“My name is Aaron. These are Mei and Ozerov. Thank you for helping us.”</p>  <p>A few barks came from the crowd, resounding above the multitude of heads that had gathered there.</p>  <p>“We’re from Earth.” said Aaron pointing towards the sky.</p>  <p>A few natives looked upwards and then back at Aaron, scratching their heads. By then, a few children had poked their heads behind their parents’ legs, giggling and pointing their fingers at the astronauts.</p>  <p>One of the natives who had led them to the settlement eventually walked forward with his teeth exposed, the stones which decorated his braids clinking as he stepped. Mei took a sharp breath, terrified at what the native might do. If the villagers decided to kill them, there was no chance of escape.</p>  <p>However, as soon as he got next to the astronauts, the native turned towards the other villagers and growled, prompting the crowd to cheer. He then placed his hand on Aaron’s shoulder and led the astronauts into the large stone building. Many others followed them inside, where a large piece of leather was spread on the floor and a fire was burning in a corner. The natives sat down on the ground, beside the leather, and the astronauts followed their example, sitting down next to each other. The villager who had led them inside said a few words in their language and everybody started talking and laughing.</p>  <p>The piece of leather turned out to be a table, that was soon filled with numerous dishes made out of fish. Mei had in front of her a flat stone, which served as a plate, and a stone bowl with steaming algae soup. She filled her plate with a bit of everything and her crewmates did the same.</p>  <p>“Is it safe to eat?” said Aaron.</p>  <p>“One way to find out,” said Vlad taking a big bite from a charred fish. “Oh, yeah, that’s good. Much better than those rations.”</p>  <p>Mei started eating. She didn’t know if having eaten only crackers and canned stew for the past few days had anything to do with it, but she found the fish delicious. She ate fast, occasionally trying to listen to their hosts’ conversation. When she finished eating she picked up her stone bowl.</p>  <p>As she was sipping the algae soup, she watched the shadows of those strange people around her, cast on the wall by the orange flame. With the fire next to her and the hot soup in her stomach, she finally felt like the coldness of Astraeus had left her bones.</p>  <p>“Remarkable,” said Aaron when he finished eating, “They’ve managed to do all of this without wood.”</p>  <p>Mei refilled her bowl with another serving of soup.</p>  <p>“This is what Earth could have been,” continued Aaron, “If it had been thrown away from the Sun millions of years ago.”</p>  <p>“Have you noticed,” said Vlad, “That everything that lives here is carnivorous?”</p>  <p>“It is interesting, from a scientific point of view.” said Mei. “I’d love to dissect one of these people.”</p>  <p>Vlad watched her with wide eyes, a piece of food almost falling from his mouth.</p>  <p>“That is the most disturbing thing you’ve said, Miss Ru.”</p>  <p>“No, I didn’t mean…”</p>  <p>Vlad and Mei burst into laughter at the same time, and even Aaron let out a few chuckles.</p>  <p>“It changes everything.” said Aaron after his crewmates stopped laughing. “We can’t destroy the planet.”</p>  <p>Vlad took a sip of his soup, eyes fixed on Aaron.</p>  <p>“What other choice do we have?” he said.</p>  <p>“We need to try and figure out something else.” said Mei.</p>  <p>Aaron and Vlad both turned their heads in her direction. Mei tried to bury her chin in her chest, playing with a piece of meat left of her plate. Aaron drank his soup in small gulps, Vlad’s stare demanding a reply.</p>  <p>“Mei’s right,” said Aaron placing the empty bowl on the table, “These are people, not animals. We can’t just destroy their planet. We can’t simply kill them to save ourselves.”</p>  <p>Mei scratched her forehead, looking at Vlad from underneath her hand.</p>  <p>“Come up with another solution, Goode. If Astraeus hits the Earth, then both planets get destroyed. Destroying one to save the other is worth it.”</p>  <p>Aaron and Vlad were leaning forward towards each other as they were speaking. Mei shuffled in place, turning her body towards them. The fire in the corner of the room was dying, its last sparks rising towards the ceiling. The voices of the villagers, content after their dinner, were softer. Mei looked around the table, where friends were smiling at each other and men were holding their wives in their arms.</p>  <p>“Is it that simple, Ozerov?” asked Aaron. “Is that how much you value life?”</p>  <p>“I’m just afraid I don’t see another way out of this.”</p>  <p>“There’s still time, we don’t have to decide now.” said Mei.</p>  <p>“What you’re suggesting is genocide.”</p>  <p>“What I’m suggesting is survival.”</p>  <p>Neither of the men replied to Mei. Aaron straightened his back, placed his hands on his legs and looked away from Vlad.</p>  <p>“I’m the leader, we do as I say.” said Aaron.</p>  <p>Mei buried her face in her hands, exasperated at Aaron and Vlad’s stubbornness. </p>  <p>“Some leadership,” said Vlad slamming the empty bowl on the leather table. “You’re an idiot, Goode. You can’t think straight, you’ve been putting us in danger since we got here.”</p>  <p>The villagers had all stopped talking and were looking at the three humans with curious expressions on their faces.</p>  <p>“Enough!” shouted Aaron. “I’m sick of your attitude, Ozerov.”</p>  <p>The men sprung up at the same time. Mei stood up, smiling at the villagers who had pulled away from the table. For a few moments, nobody said anything, the two men sizing each other up. Aaron was standing straight and confident, but Vlad was hunched into a savage position. His face was contorted into a frown, as he spoke between his teeth:</p>  <p>“The hell with you, Goode, you don’t have the guts to do what needs to be done. I’ll do you a favour and arm the bomb right now.”</p>  <p>Vlad turned around and rushed outside, with Aaron and Mei after him.</p>  <p>“What is wrong with you two?” said Mei, trying to stop Aaron in his stride.</p>  <p>Aaron gently pushed Mei aside and, as Vlad was walking away from him, he kicked the engineer in the back of his leg. Vlad fell on his knees, but immediately bounced back up. Before he could react, Aaron punched him in the face and kneed him in the stomach. Vlad responded with an uppercut in the chin.</p>  <p>Mei grabbed each of them by the shoulder and pulled them apart.</p>  <p>“Stop.” she shouted. “Just stop for one second and listen to each other.”</p>  <p>Many villagers, including the ones they had sat down with, had rushed out of their houses and were watching the display from a safe distance.</p>  <p>“Miss Ru, this is between me and cowboy Goode. You’ve seen it, you’ve seen his leadership.”</p>  <p>Mei held Aaron’s shoulder tight, as he tried to attack Vlad once more.</p>  <p>“I’ve told you before, Mei,” said Aaron, “Ozerov isn’t a team player.”</p>  <p>“Damn it, Goode, how stupid can you be? You would risk the Earth to save this rock?”</p>  <p>Aaron shoved Mei to the side and she fell on her back. He took one step towards Vlad, both his fists meeting the engineer’s face. While Vlad was still recovering from the hit, Aaron tripped him, sending him to the ground. Vlad then quickly threw dust in Aaron’s eyes and crawled away, getting back up on his feet. Vlad rammed into Aaron at full speed and they both fell on the sharp rocks. Vlad straddled Aaron and began landing punches. With one kick, Aaron knocked Ozerov off of him and grabbed him in a headlock.</p>  <p>Mei had watched the brief fight from where she had fallen. When she saw that Aaron wasn’t letting go of Vlad’s neck, she stood up. She grabbed Aaron by the shoulder and, turning his body towards her, she punched him in the face. She immediately took her fist in her other hand, rubbing her aching knuckles.</p>  <p>Vlad and Aaron both stood up on their feet, a good distance separating them.</p>  <p>“We still have time to think about it.” said Mei. “Maybe we can save both planets, we at least have to consider it.”</p>  <p>Vlad ran a hand over his beard.</p>  <p>“I’m going to sleep in the rover.” he said, abruptly turning around and leaving.</p>  <p>Aaron and Mei went into the large house, which had been deserted. A few remaining embers from the fire were dying out in a red glow, as the outside darkness was taking over. </p>  <p>Aaron walked a few steps and collapsed on the floor. With his face in his hands, he started sobbing, as Mei knelt beside him. She placed an arm around him and held his head against her chest until he had calmed down.</p>  <p>“I’m sorry, Mei.” he said. “Ozerov’s right, I’ve been an awful leader.”</p>  <p>“No, that’s not true. You’ve done what you thought was right.”</p>  <p>Aaron pushed himself away from Mei, rubbing his eyes.</p>  <p>“I’ve been so afraid of failing that I didn’t stop to listen to what you two were saying. I’ve been afraid of letting them down.”</p>  <p>Mei placed her hand on top of Aaron’s.</p>  <p>“Letting them down?”</p>  <p>Aaron looked at her with a forced smile that evaporated after a brief moment.</p>  <p>“My parents. They taught me to always do the right thing. I’ve tried to live up to that ever since…”</p>  <p>He took a deep breath and Mei encouraged him by squeezing his hand.</p>  <p>“Ever since they died. I must’ve been about sixteen. A burglar broke into our house. My dad tried to stop him but got shot. I think the burglar was scared at what he’d done. My mom screamed, and he shot her too. Ever since that, I’ve tried to make them proud.”</p>  <p>“Did they ever catch the burglar?”</p>  <p>“They did. And they imprisoned him for life. But none of that matters. I’ve made rash decisions that put you in danger, all because I thought I had something to prove. And instead of making us work together, I turned Ozerov against us. Maybe he’s right, maybe we just have to destroy Astraeus.”</p>  <p>Mei let go of his hand.</p>  <p>“We didn’t come here to be murderers.”</p>  <p>“I wish I knew what they’d say to me right now if they were still alive.”</p>  <p>The fire had completely gone out and darkness lay between the two astronauts.</p>  <p>“They’d tell you to do what you think is right. They’d tell you to stop trying to be like them and be Aaron Goode instead. As long as you do that, I’m sure they’d be proud.”</p>  <p>Aaron turned his face towards her and, despite the darkness, she could see a smile on his lips.</p>  <p>They went to sleep without their sleeping bags, which had been left in the rover. They slept as close to each other as they could, to keep warm. A few hours passed, time in which every soul in the village, under the starry skies of the eternal night, forgot about the horrors of living on Astraeus.</p>  <p>When she woke up, Mei made her way between the stone huts, to the rover. When she got there, still trying to shake the tiredness out of her brain, Vlad was already awoken, rummaging through the rations.</p>  <p>“Aaron’s sorry for what happened.” she said, stopping a few metres away from him.</p>  <p>Vlad took his head out of the ration box, his face looking weary in the headlights.</p>  <p>“It’s my fault too,” he said. “You’re right, we still have time to decide. And I can’t say it hasn’t been fun instigating him all this time.”</p>  <p>He then turned his head towards her and said with a grin:</p>  <p>“Nice punch, by the way.”</p>  <p>“Thanks.” said Mei, feeling her cheeks blushing. “I think I should punch the both of you every day.”</p>  <p>“I like having teeth, so maybe you should just go after Goode.”</p>  <p>Vlad closed the ration box and threw it in the trunk.</p>  <p>“The hell with this, let’s see if there’s any real food left.”</p>  <p>They walked at a slow pace, Vlad with his eyes fixed on the ground, raising an eyebrow occasionally. They heard a noise coming from one of the huts, prompting Vlad to look up, as two children ran outside into the snow. They chased each other on their way to the astronauts, before stopping right in front of them. With small steps, one of the children walked towards Vlad and hugged him, before they both continued their chase. For a brief second, Mei thought she saw a smile on Vlad’s face.</p>  <p>“Are you ok?” she asked.</p>  <p>He looked into the distance, with a deep sigh.</p>  <p>“Just reminds me of home a little, that’s all. Reminds me of the village I grew up in.”</p>  <p>He paused and stared into the distance.</p>  <p>“There are a lot of things I don’t show.” he said. “I don’t like to open up to people, Miss Ru, I don’t like it when others know how I feel. I’ve already told you more than I would have told anybody else, so let’s just leave it at that.”</p>  <p>They continued in silence, Mei deciding not to press Vlad into talking. When they got to the large house, Aaron and a group of villagers were waiting for them. Aaron and Vlad nodded at each other, without making a single noise. Some of the villagers were carrying nets and a few others rope darts.</p>  <p>“I think they want us to go fishing with them.” said Aaron towards Mei.</p>  <p>“It would be interesting to observe their customs.” said Mei, as Vlad was nodding in approval.</p>  <p>The astronauts followed the villagers and they reached the coast after a few minutes of walking. The frozen ocean extended all the way to the black horizon. The white surface of the ice seemed almost unreal, like something that had jumped out of a dream. Mei wondered what kind of creatures lived under that ice, in the water. She had seen fish and algae, which were similar to their counterparts on Earth, but she knew that beneath the thick ice, in the nurturing heat of underwater volcanoes, monsters that she had no name for could exist. What leviathans that had never known starlight lurked in the dark, unseen by even the peaceful villagers? A chill crawled up her spine and she decided she never wanted to know the answer.</p>  <p>They stepped on the ice which felt as solid as the rocky surface. Mei walked at the back of the group, with Aaron and Vlad in front of her, a few good metres away from each other. They followed the natives until the shore was barely visible anymore. At that point, the villagers stopped and began cutting circular holes in the ice, revealing the liquid water underneath. They cast their nets into the holes, propping them with heavy stones, and sat down on the ice grumbling in their language.</p>  <p>A loud shriek came from the distance. Mei looked in the direction that the noise came from. Plastered across the sky, even darker than the night, was a cloud that was moving towards them. More screeches followed, as Mei noticed that the cloud was actually a swarm of flying creatures. The villagers growled and picked up their rope darts, swinging them in preparation for an attack. A few of the natives ran towards the village and got all the way to the shore. Mei wanted to shout when the beasts rained down on them and put an end to their lives.</p>  <p>When they got closer, some of the animals landed on the ice, allowing Mei to get a better look at them. They were covered in short, black fur, instead of the white that they’d seen in the other animals. They had four legs ending in sharp claws, some of which were soaked in the blood of the freshly killed villagers. Their front legs were folded inwards, hiding their wings. They had small heads, compared to the rest of their bodies, with mouths like that of a leech.</p>  <p>The winged beasts swarmed towards the group and hovered above their heads, coming down at them occasionally. Whenever one of the creatures would dare attack, the villagers would launch their rope darts, keeping it at bay. The astronauts had ducked and were covering their heads.</p>  <p>One of the creatures flew downwards, aiming for Mei. The rope darts swung by the villagers all missed their target. Mei saw the shadow of a man rise above her, as the beast was fast approaching. Vlad grabbed the animal by one leg and pulled it away from its target. With flapping wings, it tried to get away from the man who was now holding it by both its hind legs. Unable to escape from Vlad’s clutches, the animal reversed direction, trying to attack the man. Its leech mouth was only a few centimetres away from Vlad’s face and its wings were beating his head as they flapped. The creature let out a screech, which caused Vlad to fall to the ground, covering his ears, with the animal on top of him.</p>  <p>The creature dug its claws inside Vlad’s stomach. Blood gushed out of his mouth and dripped onto his beard. The natives swung their rope darts once again, piercing the animal’s body, killing it. The other flying creatures, seeing how strong their opponents were, abandoned the hunt. They picked up the villagers they had killed on the shore and flew away into the night until their screeches were no longer heard.</p>  <p>Mei crawled towards Vlad, barely able to look at her friend, who was coughing and breathing heavily in a pool of his own blood. Mei grabbed his hand, unable to say any of the comforting words that came into her mind. Aaron came to them, kneeling beside Vlad.</p>  <p>“Mei, he’s the only one who knows how to arm the bomb.” he whispered.</p>  <p>“How can you…when he’s like this?” she said.</p>  <p>Aaron placed a hand on Mei’s cheek.</p>  <p>“You can do this. You can save him.”</p>  <p>Mei squeezed Vlad’s hand as hard as she could. He was looking at them, but his eyes were out of focus. He was struggling to breathe, couldn’t lift his arms and his blood was seeping into the cracks in the ice.</p>  <p>Mei stood up. She walked in front of the villagers, who were watching the scene quietly.</p>  <p>“Pick him up and follow me.” she said pointing towards Vlad.</p>  <p>The villagers rolled Vlad onto one of their fishing nets and picked him up. Mei ran in front of them towards the shore, with Aaron at her side. In a few minutes, they were in the village, making their way between the stone huts.</p>  <p>“Aaron, go to the rover and get my kit.” said Mei.</p>  <p>Aaron turned right and ran out of view, while Mei led the natives into the large house, where they placed Vlad on a piece of leather.</p>  <p>“Light a fire.” said Mei pointing towards the burnt-out algae from before.</p>  <p>The villagers ran outside, came back with fuel and lit the fire. Mei took Vlad’s jacket and shirt off and placed them under his head. He had six wounds in his abdomen, internal bleeding and two broken ribs. Mei stood up and warmed her fingers by the fire. When she stepped away from the flame, Aaron rushed into the house and dropped the medical kit next to Vlad. He then went outside and chased the natives away, who were curiously peeking inside the hut.</p>  <p>Mei opened the box and grabbed a scalpel. Her main priority was to stop the internal bleeding. She pressed the blade against Vlad’s skin and made a large incision into his abdomen, trying not to think about what alien diseases could be in the air. She moved the skin to the side, revealing Vlad’s entrails.</p>  <p>The six wounds were all bleeding internally. She took the laser from the medical box and pointed it at one of the wounds. She had to work fast, as the laser’s battery wouldn’t last very long. She switched it on and the red beam of light hit the wound, cauterizing it within minutes. She moved to the next one, and then to the following four, until she had stopped the bleeding completely. She moved the skin back and sealed Vlad’s abdomen with the laser. She took a syringe from the kit, filled it with a strong antibiotic and injected it in Vlad’s arm, to help fight any potential infection.</p>  <p>She then walked outside, where Aaron was waiting for her. She leaned against the stone wall and burst into tears. Aaron placed his arm around her shoulders and shook her vigorously.</p>  <p>“I’ve done all I could. He’s stable for now, but I don’t know what’s going to happen next. If he dies—”</p>  <p>“Don’t even say that.”</p>  <p>Aaron slid to the ground and Mei sat down next to him, in the snow.</p>  <p>“It’s all my fault.” said Aaron.</p>  <p>“Not entirely.”</p>  <p>Mei watched the children playing in the snow, as if nobody from their village had died.</p>  <p>“You haven’t always been a good leader, but he’s often provoked you and enjoyed it. And I didn’t say anything to either of you about it.”</p>  <p>She dug her fingers in the snow, crumpling it in her fist. Vlad’s blood was still underneath her fingernails.</p>  <p>“When he gets better, you’re going in there and the two of you are finding a way to save this planet.”</p>  <p>She stood up and walked away.</p>  <p>For 24 hours they waited, unsure if Vlad was going to live. Eventually, the engineer woke up and spoke a few words. He ate a bowl of soup and went back to sleep. After a few more hours passed, he woke up again and stayed awake until dinner time. After he ate something more substantial than soup, he went to sleep for another eight hours.</p>  <p>After they had a small breakfast, the astronauts were all sitting in the large building. Mei was beside the fire, lost in her thoughts, and Aaron and Vlad were staring at a computer screen.</p>  <p>“Goode, I shouldn’t have instigated you.” said Vlad. “But you’re still a bad leader.”</p>  <p>Mei raised her eyebrows, ready to intervene if either of them said something she didn’t like.</p>  <p>“You’re right.” said Aaron. “I should’ve listened more.”</p>  <p>“Never mind.” said Vlad. “Hey, I feel like eating some of those sausages from the rations, does anybody else…”</p>  <p>“Shut up, Ozerov.” said Aaron pointing at the screen. “We might be able to save Astraeus.”</p>  <p>Mei held her breath when she heard those words. She crawled next to Aaron and looked at the screen.</p>  <p>“This is our trajectory back to Earth.” said Aaron following a line with his finger. “If we detonate the bomb at this point, 200 kilometres away from Astraeus, we can send it away from the solar system intact. Does the bomb have enough energy for that?”</p>  <p>Vlad picked up the screen from Aaron’s hands.</p>  <p>“Given the mass and speed of the planet, I’d say yes. It should produce enough force to fling Astraeus away.”</p>  <p>“Let me see.” said Aaron tapping at the screen. “This should send it towards another star system and lock it in a very wide orbit. It wouldn’t disrupt life on the surface.”</p>  <p>“Would that really work?” asked Mei.</p>  <p>“It’s a gamble.” said Vlad. “We’d be taking a big risk. If this fails, we won’t get another chance to safely blow it up.”</p>  <p>“It will work.” said Aaron. “However, we only have 48 hours to act.”</p>  <p>Mei stood up and paced around the room.</p>  <p>“Means we need to go now.” said Vlad.</p>  <p>Having said that, Vlad stood up, balancing himself with one hand against the wall. He groaned and wrapped his arm around his abdomen, taking a few steps towards Mei. His face showed only determination. Aaron stood up as well and the two men nodded at each other.</p>  <p>The astronauts went to the rover and made sure everything was packed. When they got in their seats and turned on the engine, some of the villagers came to see what was happening. Aaron got out of the rover and stood in front of the crowd.</p>  <p>“He does know that they don’t understand him, right?” said Vlad.</p>  <p>Aaron walked up to the villagers smiling.</p>  <p>“We need to go now. Thank you for all you’ve done for us. I wish that, as the more advanced species, we could give you something. But the truth is that we’re not the more advanced species. All the time we’ve been here, we’ve seen no sign of violence or greed among you. I hope that’s something we can take home, to Earth, as a gift from a more advanced species.”</p>  <p>The chieftain, the one who had first shown them into the large house, walked past Aaron and stopped next to the rover. He was holding stone beads, like the ones he was wearing in his fur. He gave one to Mei and one to Vlad, before turning around towards Aaron and giving him the last. The chieftain then extended his hand towards Aaron and the pilot shook it with a smile.</p>  <p>Vlad picked up something from the floor of the car and jumped outside. It was his keychain, which had fallen when the rover had been tipped over. Vlad went to the crowd of villagers, where the child who had hugged him was standing behind his mother. Vlad knelt and nodded in the child’s direction. With timid steps, the child went to Vlad, who put the keychain in his small hands.</p>  <p>“This is Matryoshka. Take good care of her.”</p>  <p>Vlad stood up and sat back in his seat. Aaron took his place behind the steering wheel, turned on the headlights and drove away, leaving the village behind. Mei couldn’t help wondering how, if at all, the natives would remember them in centuries to come. Would they know that they had been saved by people from another world? She hoped that, one day, humans and the natives of Astraeus would meet again, so that they could learn about the three astronauts who visited them during their prehistory.</p>  <p>The following 24 hours were uneventful. Aaron had driven almost without stopping and Mei had completely lost track of time in her constant tiredness. They found the lander just as they left it, with its alien lights still disturbing Astraeus.</p>  <p>After they got out of the rover, they worked quickly and quietly. Vlad secured the bomb inside the lander, while Aaron and Mei carried all the remaining supplies to the storage room and raised the rover back in its place.</p>  <p>With everything loaded onto the lander, the astronauts sat down in their seats in the cockpit. Mei thought about how nervous going into space had made her feel. Now, as she was waiting for the launch, she wanted nothing more than to get the mission done. Aaron turned on the main computer and checked all the systems.</p>  <p>“The orbital module is in position.” he said. “We need to go now, otherwise we’ll have to wait until it does another complete orbit around Astraeus.”</p>  <p>As Aaron turned on the engine, Mei tried to ignore the sinking sensation in her stomach. “It’s just space. I’ve been there before.” she thought. The lander wobbled, but Aaron fired the thrusters to stabilize it. He then retracted the legs and increased the engine throttle. The lander picked up speed, soaring through the dark skies into the upper layers of the atmosphere.</p>  <p>Mei looked at the planet surface—which she had found desolate and hostile not too long ago—that felt almost like a second home. Somewhere, on that ball of rock and ice, were people that she cared about and that she’d do all in her power to save. As the terrain details were disappearing into the eternal night, more of the planet revealed itself, unfolding it’s strange, yet familiar, face.</p>  <p>Aaron turned in his chair and looked at Mei with a smile.</p>  <p>“Launching never gets old,” he said. “Ok, we have a stable orbit. Our altitude is perfectly matching that of the orbital module, which is right behind us.”</p>  <p>Aaron fired the thrusters, spinning the lander backwards. After stopping the rotation, he fired the engine, slowing down the lander and allowing the orbital module to catch up. When they saw it approach through the front window, Aaron rotated the lander forwards once more and fired the engine. The lander accelerated, until its speed was only slightly lower than that of the orbital module.</p>  <p>The lander shook as the orbital module gently hit it.</p>  <p>“Securing clamps.” said Aaron.</p>  <p>A metallic noise resounded through the spacecraft, letting them know that the lander and the orbital module were securely attached. Mei took one last look at the grey contours of the rogue planet, lit up against the cold background of space by the fiery orange volcanoes.</p>  <p>Aaron turned on the engine, punching in the trajectory they were to follow. The spaceship left orbit and flew away from Astraeus at high speed. Soon, they couldn’t see the planet anymore. Aaron had stopped the engines. They were in deep space, surrounded on all sides by the enormous universe, with specks of light floating through its nothingness. Although they were going towards the Sun, the star remained as small as any other. Aaron’s words resounded in Mei’s mind: “Distance has a gift of making important things seem small and insignificant.” The universe, in spite of its incomprehensible scale, was irrelevant to Mei. All that mattered was the safety of the Earth and Astraeus.</p>  <p>After 20 hours passed, Mei—who was staring at a screen—said: </p>  <p>“This is the right place.”</p>  <p>Aaron immediately grabbed the controls. He turned on the thrusters and rotated the spaceship 180 degrees. He turned the engine back on and the ship slowed down to a halt. When they were no longer moving, Aaron turned the engine off, stopping them in place.</p>  <p>Mei looked at her crewmates, waiting for one of them to do something. At the same time, Aaron and Vlad unbuckled their seatbelts and their bodies started drifting away from the seats. Mei unbuckled her seatbelt also and, pushing herself off the chair, floated towards Aaron and Vlad.</p>  <p>“How precise do we have to be with the explosion?” asked Vlad.</p>  <p>“We need to be within a radius of one kilometre of our current position. By cosmic standards, that’s very precise. By our standards, we don’t need to worry about it.”</p>  <p>Vlad ran a hand over his beard, his stare fixed on Aaron and Mei. His eyes weren’t playful anymore.</p>  <p>“Goode, if we somehow screw this up…”</p>  <p>“Astraeus is almost in the Sun’s gravitational well. It’ll soon be too late to divert it or any debris. We only have one shot at this, so we need to do it right.”</p>  <p>Aaron propelled himself across the cockpit, opened the door into the orbital module and went inside it. Vlad and Mei followed him closely into the storage room. Metal crates were tied to the walls and a long table was bolted into what Mei decided was the floor.</p>  <p>“So, what’s the plan?” asked Vlad.</p>  <p>“What do you need, Ozerov? This is your time to shine.”</p>  <p>Vlad chuckled in Mei’s direction and grabbed onto the metal table to stop himself from drifting around the room.</p>  <p>“You’re not going to like this, Goode. I need someone to go out there with me. I can’t arm the bomb on my own, not in space. I need somebody to hold it steady for me.”</p>  <p>Aaron raised his eyebrows and smiled at Vlad in the corner of his mouth.</p>  <p>“You’re right, I don’t like this. Alright, let’s do it. Mei, you’re in charge of communications.”</p>  <p>Aaron and Vlad put on their spacesuits and floated inside the airlock. They checked their headsets, making sure they could hear each other, as well as Mei’s voice. They made sure that their jetpacks were functioning, which would provide them a means of propulsion in case of emergency. Vlad tied a toolbox to the frame of the bomb. After the airlock was depressurized, the door opened revealing empty space. They both clasped the tether cables onto their belts and, after Aaron took the bomb in his arms, jumped off the edge of the spacecraft.</p>  <p>“You’ve been on spacewalks before, haven’t you, Ozerov?”</p>  <p>“I have…in the simulator.”</p>  <p>Mei heard Aaron sigh in her earphone and could imagine him rolling his eyes.</p>  <p>“Let’s just get this done.” he said.</p>  <p>Aaron and Vlad floated towards the front of the ship, so that Mei could see them from the cockpit window, as she was sitting in the pilot’s chair. The helmets were hiding their faces, the only way to distinguish between the two being by the flags imprinted on their shoulders.</p>  <p>“How’s the signal, Mei?” asked Aaron waving at her. “Can you hear me?”</p>  <p>“Loud and clear.” she answered waving back.</p>  <p>At first, Mei had been jealous that she wouldn’t get to go outside the spaceship, even if she knew she’d be useless out there. Now, the sight of the two men floating unnaturally with no ground to support them gave her a very disturbing feeling. She tried to forget that the spacecraft was also, essentially, floating through what was the definition of nothingness.</p>  <p>“Alright, Ozerov, let’s get to work.”</p>  <p>“Try to hold the bomb steady while I type in the security codes. This shouldn’t take long.”</p>  <p>Mei watched Vlad and Aaron rotate around the same axis, with the bomb between them, as if they were doing a swaying dance. Vlad was punching in commands on the small dial, visibly frustrated by the big gloves he was forced to wear. He kept pausing to squeeze his fist and then stretch out his fingers before continuing with his task.</p>  <p>“I’ve got it.” he said eventually. “Just setting the timer. Hold on a second, this isn’t right.”</p>  <p>Mei almost stood up, the seatbelt having stopped her from floating out of her chair.</p>  <p>“What’s wrong, Ozerov?”</p>  <p>“It won’t start the detonation cycle, I don’t know why.”</p>  <p>“Can you fix it?”</p>  <p>For a few seconds, Mei couldn’t hear anything on the radio.</p>  <p>“I don’t know.” said Vlad eventually.</p>  <p>Vlad opened the toolbox and picked up a screwdriver. One by one, he took out the four screws that closed the case of the bomb. The screws, once Vlad had let go of them, wandered away into space until Mei couldn’t see them anymore. Vlad placed the screwdriver back in the box and took some pliers.</p>  <p>“I’ll have to rip the seal off, but it’s really strong.” he said. “Hold on tight, Goode.”</p>  <p>“I hear you.”</p>  <p>Vlad grabbed the seal with the pliers and pulled at it, with his other hand pushing against the bomb. When the seal snapped, Vlad and Aaron were thrown in opposite directions. Mei saw the pliers fly from Vlad’s hand and follow the screws into deep space. While Aaron flew out of sight, Vlad’s body went limp for a few brief moments as the tether cable tensed. He shook his head and pulled at the cable, stopping his motion.</p>  <p>“Vlad, are you ok?” asked Mei.</p>  <p>“Miss Ru, I shouldn’t have eaten those meatballs with tomato sauce. Goode, you’re still with us?”</p>  <p>“I’m here, Ozerov. I’m coming back towards you.”</p>  <p>“Is it safe to throw up in the suit?”</p>  <p>“No. Whatever you do, don’t throw up unless you want to suffocate on your own vomit.”</p>  <p>Mei saw the glow from Aaron’s jetpack before he came back into her view, carrying the bomb with him. Vlad grabbed onto the bomb once again and the men resumed their positions.</p>  <p>“Now, Ozerov, can you fix it?”</p>  <p>Vlad looked inside the bomb case for a few moments, before saying:</p>  <p>“I don’t remember this being here. The other engineers, they must have had orders to install this.”</p>  <p>“What is it?” asked Mei.</p>  <p>“Does either of you remember when I said all of this was a political scheme?” said Vlad dramatically. “Well, I was right. The world’s governments were distrustful of each other, worried about sending an antimatter bomb in space.”</p>  <p>“Ozerov, what is it?” said Aaron.</p>  <p>“A simple accelerometer, Goode. If it doesn’t register a gravitational acceleration equal to that of Astraeus, it will not arm the bomb. It would prevent us from arming it in space and launching it against the Earth.”</p>  <p>Mei saw the two men look at each other, even if neither of them could see the other’s face through the helmets. She was the first to break the silence:</p>  <p>“What can we do about it?”</p>  <p>“Nothing, Miss Ru.” said Vlad. “We screwed up. We need to go back and plant the bomb on the surface. We should have enough fuel for another landing.”</p>  <p>“By the time we get there,” said Aaron, “We won’t be able to divert the debris anymore.”</p>  <p>“There has to be something.” said Mei slamming her hands against the chair armrests.</p>  <p>“Rotation.” said Aaron. “We use our jetpacks to spin the bomb until the centripetal acceleration seen by the accelerometer is equal to that of the gravity on Astraeus.”</p>  <p>Mei scratched her head, trying to understand what Aaron had just babbled.</p>  <p>“That might work, Goode.” said Vlad. “Give me the bomb, I’ll do it.”</p>  <p>“I can’t let you do this, Ozerov. Don’t you realize how dangerous it is?”</p>  <p>“After the bomb is armed, I’m expendable. But you’re the pilot, the mission still needs you. Now give me the bomb, Goode.”</p>  <p>Aaron released the bomb from his hands and let his arms float in front of him. Vlad untied his tether cable from his belt and, with one short burst from his jetpack, put some distance between himself and Aaron. Mei had just realized that he was about to spin the bomb.</p>  <p>Vlad turned on his jetpack at full throttle and he started to spin in a tight circle. The bomb was in the centre of the rotation, so that it spun without changing position. Vlad was holding on to the frame, his legs dangling behind him.</p>  <p>“The bomb is armed.” said Vlad’s voice in Mei’s earphones.</p>  <p>Aaron turned towards Mei, so that she could see the reflection of the ship’s lights in his black visor.</p>  <p>“I’m going to let go.” said Vlad’s voice.</p>  <p>Vlad let go of the frame and flew away from it, as the bomb still rotated in place. Vlad’s jetpack burst with a bright flash and started burning fuel at an uncontrollable rate. Mei watched Vlad fly into the distance, until the jetpack stopped, leaving him floating away at high speed.</p>  <p>“Ozerov,” said Aaron, “Turn around, you’re going too far.”</p>  <p>“Jetpack failure. It’s stuck now.”</p>  <p>Mei watched as Vlad turned into a white spot in the distance.</p>  <p>“Goode, there’s a rupture in my suit. I’m losing oxygen.”</p>  <p>“Hold on, I’m coming to get you.”</p>  <p>Mei saw Aaron untie his tether cable and turn on his jetpack, flying in Vlad’s direction.</p>  <p>“Go back, Goode, I’m too far away now.”</p>  <p>“No way!”</p>  <p>“Goode, make the smart choice this time.”</p>  <p>Mei squeezed the armrests, watching Aaron fly away in a blaze of jetpack flame.</p>  <p>“Mei, listen closely. He won’t last the trip back. I need you to bring the ship to us.”</p>  <p>“What? I don’t know how.”</p>  <p>“You’ll be fine, it’s not that difficult. Just follow my instructions.”</p>  <p>Mei placed her shaking fingers on the controls. She gripped the control stick that was in front of her, trying to make sense of all the buttons and display screens on the console.</p>  <p>“Mei, there’s a blue switch towards the left. Press it.”</p>  <p>Mei flipped the switch and a roaring sound came from the rear end of the ship. The spacecraft started moving as its engines came on, but it was moving away at an angle from Aaron and Vlad.</p>  <p>“Great job, Mei. Now gently turn the control stick to your left.”</p>  <p>Mei gripped the stick with both hands, her chair shaking with her. She pulled gently at it, without any result. Aaron and Vlad had almost vanished in the distance. She pulled at the stick with all her strength. She was yanked to the right, as the ship started spinning towards the left, around its centre.</p>  <p>After a few rotations, she could see Aaron’s jetpack getting closer. The ship was drawing a semicircle in space, approaching the two men. Mei held on to the control stick, as the centrifugal force kept pushing her to the right.</p>  <p>“That’s good, Mei, now stop the rotation. Move the stick to the right.”</p>  <p>She pulled at the control, moving it as far to the right as it could go. The ship slowed down and started spinning towards the right, drawing a spiral, still on its way to the astronauts.</p>  <p>“The stick needs to be in the centre.”</p>  <p>Mei let go of the control and the thrusters stopped firing. The spacecraft only had a slow rotation, but it was still travelling fast towards the astronauts.</p>  <p>“Turn off the engine.”</p>  <p>“How?”</p>  <p>“Flip the blue switch again.”</p>  <p>Mei flipped the switch and the roaring of the engine stopped.</p>  <p>“Now what do I do?”</p>  <p>“It’s ok, I can match the speed of the ship.”</p>  <p>“What does that mean, Aaron?”</p>  <p>“I’ll come to you.”</p>  <p>The ship had gotten within a few hundred metres of the astronauts. Aaron, clinging on to Vlad’s body, soared through the sky towards the safety of the craft. Mei saw them go out of sight, to the side of the ship.</p>  <p>“Mei, close the airlock and pressurize it. Green, flashing button.”</p>  <p>Mei pressed the button and got out of her chair. She floated into the orbital module, pushing herself against the walls, until she reached the airlock. Aaron was taking off his spacesuit. Mei grabbed Vlad’s body and took his visor off. He had passed out and his skin had begun to swell.</p>  <p>“He isn’t breathing.” said Aaron.</p>  <p>Mei dashed back into the storage room, opening the crate with medical equipment. Everything floated into the room, but she managed to find what she was looking for. With the ventilator in hand, she went back into the airlock.</p>  <p>She pressed the mask on Vlad’s face and turned on the device. Vlad’s chest started expanding and contracting and he opened his eyes. He took Mei’s hand in his and took the mask off his face.</p>  <p>“I hope neither of you gave me mouth-to-mouth.” he said.</p>  <p>“I was going to,” said Mei, “But the smell of meatballs was too strong, so I used the ventilator.”</p>  <p>Vlad then looked in Aaron’s direction, who was watching from a distance.</p>  <p>“I guess we needed a surgeon after all.” said Aaron smiling.</p>  <p>Vlad floated towards Aaron, with his hand extended. Aaron took his hand and they held on, looking at each other.</p>  <p>“Thank you, Aaron. I was wrong about you, I’m sorry.”</p>  <p>“I’m sorry too, Vlad.”</p>  <p>They both smiled and let go of each other’s hand. The three astronauts went back into the cockpit and sat in their chairs. Aaron turned on the engines and the ship began accelerating away from the bomb. At some point, Aaron checked the time and said:</p>  <p>“It’s time for the fireworks, people.”</p>  <p>The screen turned white, as the antimatter bomb detonated.</p>  <p>“The shockwave has hit Astraeus,” he said. “And the planet is intact. It’s on its new vector towards a wide, stable orbit.”</p>  <p>“I’ll be damned,” said Vlad laughing.</p>  <p>“We did it.” said Mei.</p>  <p>They all shook hands without another word, as the ship went on its way to Earth, through the infinite space.</p>
