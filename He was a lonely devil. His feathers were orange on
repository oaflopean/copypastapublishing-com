He was a lonely devil. His feathers were orange on his big head. His hinds allowed for travel across hot melting rock.  He died for her in his little hells. Her throne position was empty still. A bubble around them, violent in their sex piece. 

When he ran down from the rocks, he would do a shimmy that arrested female saurian attention. This girl was the one he barked for. Roawr, came her whine to him once he pounced. This sex scene was underrated. He became lizard electrocution all up her spine. She jumped at the last moment away from him. He froze her, and forced his juice through his mouth out a thin spout he formed with his beak. The hot liquid dripped down her face when he rotated and squat on her hinds and inflicted his partiular strand of DNA on her fertile valley. This was last week's hunt.

The evil saurian takes no time in climbing the mountain. He's a guru to the caves and molehills leading to the summit. Once he reaches top, he raises flag and targets a human being. His claws want to rip and gut a man through his stomach and abdomen. The pain is secondary to the pure morbid gore it makes. He rarely eats the entire animal. Saurians prefer pork and sweet meats, but humans are rarely muscular they catch. Somehow, the species managed a peaceful life amongst rabid and violent suarians. They lived in the valley below them. Beyond the valley was where the river and forest became desert, and past that a mountain reared its volcanic head. There was the mating grounds for the evil saurians. Below the mountain, rest man.

 When she awoke, it was tanother day of jail. She forgot for a moment how long she sat there this time, over 3 months now. But when she looked outside, she could see her mnd. Here came the jailman's jabber.

 "Honk if you want her bit off, celly. Just take a lick at that strap round her beak and see if you get a bite off your claw. I'll take the damn jaws off that ferocious beast."

 The celly was in jail with saurian females. She said nothing. Not long after she awoke she was fed, a banana and wrapped fruit. Her escape would come just after breakfast, when the other animals got into a frenzy. She started screaming to arouse them. The jailman barely noticed her, but when the animals broke free he was forced to leave the jail. Celly broke free then, using a great slab of rock to break the chains holding her and the lock on her cell. 

 When she returned, her grimy self gave away what sort of thing happened to her. "Barely made it out of that scrape, Donny?"

 She collected her hair. "Got some good film of the saurians mating, friend. They're vicious up close, but when they're having sex there's no compare. Their species is a mean one."

 Her partner seemed to shiver with fear or anticipation. "You know I prefer my kitties." One of her cats was lying on her living room windowsill. The coffee was brewing from the coffee table. On one of her couches lain her other orange cat. There was a certain air like a saurian would come. Their feathered heads were sensed long before by smell than sight. The smell lingered, so a shotgun was propped above the couch in case of a dinosaur attack. Before the smell, there was also a psychological element to the attack. They came when a man's thoughts became confusing. Donny spoke again.

 "Believe me, those dinos are going to get us sometime." Everybody cringed. 

 "Why would you say something like that?" her friend asked. "You know they come when we speak of them."

 "I just feel one with them," Donny said. "When I saw his ferocious sexual power up close, I wanted in their clan. Maybe they'll accept another human being soon. Like me?"

"You should be kicked from this home," her friend's mother said. "Leave my house, now."

"I'll have you know I made a great scientific discovery today!" Donna shot back. "My film could be used in science!"

Her friend shot up her arms. "Well, the dino's are coming any time now!"

"Oh shut up about my attraction to saurians. You know they only kill who they want to die."

"What's that supposed to mean, Donna?" her friend's mom asked.

"They're like a hive. They have a hierarchal sense of power. We, at the bottom of the mountain, past the desert, are just lower on the level of power than the saurians. We'll survive one more meeting with them, at least." Then she smiled. "I can't wait to meet another, honestly."

The mother stomped Donna out of the living room and the house. Donna examined some rocks outside the residence. 

When the saurians came, nobody knew who to fire the gun. There was some culture shown by the animals. Donna asked for a plate of dino meat. She did get one, running off from a clawing saurian once she did. The people around her were mystified. The saurians retreated into the forest once again. She ripped meat from the bone when she spoke. "We'll be like them soon enough."

When the saurians came to brunch, they wanted human meat. So they ripped one of the doors open and roared into the living room. The fear of the humans reached its peak then. Donna blast the shotgun in the direction of saurians, then blast if off again in several ones' faces. The saurians retreated, and she said "That's nice. They sacrifice three for one plate. Absolutely dangerous."

On ring three of the saurian thirst, Donny took the shotgun all around the premises and banged four more. It was a massacre. They seemed attracted to Donny, wanting her flesh most of all. She ducked and dodged, and shot the heads off the largest of them. When she was done, she said, "Those damned things better not come back. I swear to God, I thought your mama was toast."

Donny's friend gave her "oh" face and they continued a kind of lunch only living in the valley could give you. 

Up on the mountain climbed the largest, most beastly saurian males. They were the ones who Donna needed to see in her lifetime. She wanted to walk through the desert, up the mountain to the volcano-- and see the devil!
