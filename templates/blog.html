</div><h3>A safer place to post your most powerful thoughts and opinions</h3>
<p>When I realized I could heal people's minds with just a single phrase, I posted everything I could in a single list on a social site. </p>
<p>I built a community of what I thought of as "singularity therapy" that I thought would inspire others to solve emotional conflicts in their personal life.</p>
<p>I continued posting my greatest inspirations in short post threads. But as I continued to gain subscribers, there wasn't a single other post. It was as if I was the only one who could write Spoilers of the Universe.</p>
<h3>The Problem with Creativity on Social Media</h3>
<p>Individuals are scared to share their opinions in America online.</p>
<p>We talk in code and scrutinize every word we read because we're afraid of what is its source.</p>
<h3>A Weblogging Site Made From Copypasta</h3>
<p>When we post, we are careful to press the correct button. In our minds, there is no room for human error. We want to find a way where a poster can freely share information regularly to be stored for future perusal.</p>
<p>What if you could simply copy paste something and create original art?</p>
<h3>Truly Effortless, Beautiful Personal Weblogging Websites</h3>
<p>I've completed HTML and CSS learning on my own, and what I found is amazing. It's even therapeutic to write in HTML!</p>
<p>I'd like to turn what I learned about divs and CSS classes and make a tool which is a joy to use for making 100% custom pages for your weblogging journal.</p>
<p>There are countless CSS stylesheets and responsive, mobile and large screen compatible websites that look as amazing as the ones I made for Copypasta.</p>
<h3>Security and Permanent Data Are Important Too</h3>
<p>I'm working from the ground up to give America a site for writing you're not afraid to share.</p>
<p>I'm a one-man editing team and I have multiple creative outlets for Copypasta to interact with consumers. My strategy is to create a giant web or net of Copypasta content and capture the audience by making myself available to the public. We have a friendly relationship with authors and want to increase our number of partners. Simply gorgeous. Marvelous. Let's go, team.</p><!-- Place <div> tag where you want the feed to appear -->
