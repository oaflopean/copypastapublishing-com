Any advice for creating likable villains?
The villains in my story are all members of a church that try to maintain order. I want them to be likable villains that aren't all just crazy evil dudes, but I always have trouble writing villains that aren't crazy evil dudes. Any advice for making my villains more interesting and likable?

A good villain has the same requirements as a good hero. They have to have a reason to do what they do. It can be as simple as greed, or greed inspired by childhood poverty or it can be more nuanced, maybe think they are doing the right thing, or the wrong thing for the right reasons. Whatever the reason, I need to know why these people are like this.

Next step is making me understand them. You want me to like a character make them grow. Give them their own story with its own conflict. Person A wants thing B but then C stops him from getting it immediately. Use this to develop them

Depends on what you mean by "likable".

People often "like" irredeemable homicidal maniacs if they ooze the right charisma. A lot of villain types fall under this.

People might find a dogmatic villain who delusionally believes what they're doing is right compelling, but not so much likable.

If written with the right complexity people might find them sympathetic, but that's more difficult. Maybe they struggle with internal conflict over their actions but believe they are a necessary evil. Can you convince the audience the villain is just from their perspective?

A likable villain will mostly fall somewhere between these ideas.

Do you mean villain, or antagonist?

That sounds similar in some ways to my own current project. What do you mean by "likable"? If the villain seems like the kind of person you'd want to invite to a party, that's hard. My own villain completely believes in what he does and has a high level of integrity. If he tries to kill you, it's because he wants to make a better world. He even calls the protagonist's attention to a blind spot in his thinking.

I hope that nobody would like him, but the reader can respect him. It sounds as if a similar approach might work for you.

Perhaps you could go to a church firsthand so you can witness both the well-meaning and the hypocritical. You could also see the influence a set of beliefs has on behavior.

By understanding that beliefs define behavior, it becomes a lot simpler to write well-meaning or less evil individuals. People could be born into a church that teaches them to hate or do evil, and they would grow up largely ignorant unless they broke away somehow/learns the truth.

These people would not only be ignorant, they might be said to be less evil than those who were taught to and how to care but rebelled anyways.
