“Waterford Police Department. What is your emergency?”
“My name is Francis Gilbert! I just caught some punk trying to rob my house! I’ve got a 357 Magnum pointed at his head! You’ve got six minutes to send the riot squad over here to arrest his ass!”
“Sir! What is your address?”
“It’s in the phone book! Six minutes and counting! Then I’m going to go all Dirty Harry and there will be nothing left but scraps!”
“Sir!”
“Click.”
“Hey man, please! Don’t kill me! I was only doing this to feed my kids!”
“Didn’t you ever hear of a j-o-b? A crack habit is more likely what you were trying to feed!”
“Seriously man!”
““It’s Francis Gilbert to you punk! Hard working, tax paying American! And I’m going to ‘seriously’ blow your brains out in five minutes, twelve seconds! You’d better pray that the cops get here!”
“No, man. I mean Mr. Gilbert! Please don’t shoot me. Please let me live.”
“So now you’re crying? Shedding tears like a prissy little girl. I can’t wait for you to shit your pants!”
“I was desperate Mr. Gilbert. I was stupid. I was looking for the easy way out.”
“Bang!”
“Oh my God!”
“A warning shot! Just like in the movies. It’s interesting that your hands went right to your crotch rather than your head. It shows where your brains are.”
“Man! You’re crazy!”
“Defiance in the face of eminent death. You gotta love it. Four minutes, eighteen seconds.”
“Help! Anybody! Please help me!”
“No lights. No sirens. No neighbors coming to see what’s going on. Guess what? Nobody knows me. I’m invisible to those who even pass me on the street. Lived here for five years and nobody has a clue. You picked the only guy in the universe who has nothing to lose by splattering your brains all over the walls.!”
“Man! There’s gotta be somebody who’s going to care about you taking the needle for this!”
“If you’re looking for the wife, the kids and the happily ever after to save your ass, forget it. I’ve got nothing and nobody. The only thing I truly have is the ability to not give a shit. Which is why in three minutes, five seconds you’re going to be another punk who got exactly what he deserved.”
“I don’t know what to say.”
“Try saying your prayers. Oh, my heart.”
“Thud!”
“What the fuck! Hey man! Move! I’m shaking you man! Can you breathe or something? Shit! He’s dead!”
“Sirens! Now what do I do? Think man think!”
One minute, forty-five seconds.
“I’ve got it! Shit! His gun is a heavy motherfucker!”
“Blam!”
“One shot to the chest!”
One minute, five seconds.
“Here comes the tough part. A flesh wound to the leg. I’ve had a couple so I know where to point this sucker.”
“Blam!”
“There you have it. Self-defense.”
Forty -three seconds.
“One more thing. Nothing in his pockets. No ID. This fucker was a ghost.”
“This is Jensen. We just pulled up to the house. Neighbors said they heard shots.”
Fifteen seconds.
“This is the police! Come out with your hands up!”
“So I drag myself to the door and,” midnight.
“Okay don’t shoot! My name is Francis Gilbert. I’m coming out!”
“This should be easy. A quick trip to the hospital. A sit down with the cops. Then it’s ‘don’t leave town we may have further questions’. Then I leave town.”
“Here he comes! Hey you! Down on your stomach! Spread your arms and legs!. Suspect down.”
“Hey! Why you cuffing me? I’m the one who called you guys. I caught this punk trying to rob my house.”
“Yeah we know all about it.”
“He pulled a piece on me. I grabbed for the gun. The gun went off! Look at my leg! I got the gun away and blew his ass away like any good American would.”
“You found the perp’s body. Call the meat wagon.”
“See. It’s like I told you. Self-defense.”
“Sounds open and shut to me. You should be out in no time Mr. Gilbert.”
“Wow! That’s more like it! Now about the cuffs?”
“Oh I think we’ll keep those on for a while. It turns out your reputation, ah.”
“What reputation? What are you talking about?”
“If you must ask me this, I will try to explain. It seems that some people pretty high up on the world scene have been looking for you. According to our notes, As Moustapha, the Jackal, you were responsible for a terrorist bombing in Mozambique that killed 500 operatives.”
“What are you talking about? I’m Francis Gilbert!”
“We’ll get to that. You were Gregory Sin Q in 2010. Led a group of suicide bombers that took out a US Army barracks. A lot of people died. You didn’t.”
“Are you out of your mind? I’m Francis Gilbert!”
“The Oklahoma bombing. 911. Acid attacks in Northern Ireland. You’ve even had a hand in the voting scandal in Alabama. You’ve been a busy boy. Different names. Different faces. Nobody had a clue who you were.”
“Until a two-bit wannabe was turned by the CIA. It turns out that a politico who was too left for the extreme right was about to eat lead death.”
“And the guy pulling the trigger was going by the name of Francis Gilbert.”
