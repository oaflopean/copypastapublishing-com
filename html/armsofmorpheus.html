<p>ARMS OF MORPHEUS</p><p>Life sings sweetly in my ear, </p><p>A melody as rich as I could ever hear,</p><p>\"I know that I will feel my final gasp </p><p>All too soon, it's there waiting.\"</p><p>I have come to know death's gentle grasp</p><p>A sonorous tap reminds me my end is near</p><p>just around the corner, out of sight. </p><p>My eyes look in wonder at the beauty around </p><p>Even light has a viscous richness </p><p>I have only just seen. </p><p>My breath comes that little more slowly </p><p>Anger has departed only sadness remains. </p><p>She sings a song of Sorrow </p><p>A lament that I know all too well. </p><p>My heart has begun its final journey </p><p>Death and I are acquainted now.</p><p>In Morpheus's soft arms I dream I'm flying, </p><p>high above in the mountains clear</p><p>My wife and children laughing beside me </p><p>I feel happiness and glee.  </p><p>A bird of fire takes me up </p><p>Soaring higher and higher in her wings</p><p>I'm carried away on the summer breeze </p><p>Happy at last. </p>
