<p>FREJA: 3. MY PRINCESS</p><p>Over dark pools streaked with crimson, dragonflies, whirl and twirl,</p><p>Glimmering and glittering like precious jewels.</p><p>Glimmering and glittering forming a living crown on her pale brow.</p><p>Feathers of darkness flutter down and down </p><p>Covering her emaciated body in a soft cloak the colour of jet.</p><p>And tears, her tears are tears of blood. </p><p>Dripping and trickling tainting the calmness of the mill pond with the essence of her.</p><p>The girl that once laughed, the girl that once was a shining star, </p><p>The girl who had dreams and aspirations, the girl whose life is draining away, </p><p>Alone, alone and into nothingness.</p><p>But cry blood no longer my love, cry blood no longer, </p><p>For soon enough the warmth and golden colour</p><p>Of the sun will seep across the meadows and across your vulnerable body, </p><p>Gently cloaking and caressing you in it's golden finery.</p><p>And when the time is right my love, you will be led to your throne amongst the stars.</p><p>Where your head will be adorned with a colourful crown of dragonflies,</p><p>Your body will be finely cloaked in dark feathers, laced with golden sunlight.</p><p>And here my Princess you will be seated, seated and at peace </p><p>Within the glorious heavenly Kingdom,</p><p>Where your soul will everlastingly reign forevermore.   </p>
