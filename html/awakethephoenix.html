<p>AWAKE THE PHOENIX</p><p>One day on wings of a fiery Phoenix </p><p>I will soar high above the plains of despair.</p><p>One day my eyes will lift heavenward and see the blue sky above for what it is, </p><p>Not what it might be.</p><p>One day peace will reign transcendent in my tortured soul,</p><p>Drawing pain from deep within like a needle draws pus from an abscess.</p><p>I await that day, every second, every minute, every working hour cries out </p><p>\"Rescue me from this misery; free my tortured soul!\"</p><p>Let me soar high above the plains of despair on wings of fire. </p><p>Let my eyes that have seen pain and suffering, burn with passion renewed!</p><p>Is there hope? </p><p>Perhaps my love for those very moments that nourish my soul will return.</p><p>A promise haunts me! In my mind's eye I still see the fiery Phoenix ablaze, </p><p>Its eyes burning bright amongst the flames that surround it. </p><p>A furnace of fire that speaks of passion, awe and love.</p><p>Whilst others watch in fear and aspiration. </p><p>But the fires have long since burnt out, </p><p>The Phoenix is dead, its ashes cooled.</p><p>The fire that once had sustained me becomes a painful memory, </p><p>A tragedy of numbness and ice ensues.</p><p>Awake!</p><p>Rise again O Phoenix!</p><p>Draw yourself from the depths of death and ignite in flame!</p><p>I summon Thee!</p>
