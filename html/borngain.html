Shortly after quenching my thirst, I became drowsy, as if in a drug-induced, dream-like state, and flashes of crimson, orange, and mauve streamed about me in waves.\</p><p>\</p><p>\pard\pardeftab720\fi260\sl300\slmult1\qj\partightenfactor0</p><p>\cf2 \strokec2 Voices, both high-pitched and low guttural, reverberated around me, all chanting, in unison, two words, over and over again: "White worm. White worm. White worm. White worm..." After some time, a new phrase sounded, "White worm is within thee." Then, a deathly silence fell.\</p><p>\</p><p>I sank to my knees, and with my hands, I dug at the rocks possessed, unable to draw a halt to my crazed actions. My flesh ripped from my bones in bloody chunks of gore, but I felt no pain. In fact, I chuckled to myself hysterically as the blood poured and spurted from my mutilated fingers.\</p><p>\</p><p>After a short time of this frenzied activity, obviously having had no impact whatsoever on the solid granite rocks that I pounded so furiously, only my bones remained. They cracked and splintered on impact as still I incessantly scrabbled at the rocks covered in pools of my congealing, sticky blood. On and on this insanity went as my arms slowly disintegrated before my disbelieving, shocked eyes. Now I was up to my elbows, and still no sign of relenting. Until after what seemed like hours, my arms were no more, and as abruptly as this madness had started, it ceased. Still feeling possessed by some otherworldly force, I sank onto my belly and rived, my body slipping along the rocks with flexibility I never knew I possessed.\</p><p>\</p><p>Like a hammer blow to my head, I suddenly realised I was now born again as a white worm, and looking horrifyingly at my skin, I could see it shone with a scaly, milk-white pallor. I screamed at the darkness, but no sound came from my mouth, which had now transformed into a slit within my flat, white head.\</p><p>\</p><p>My body with great speed and agility, darted, without my control, into the darkness of the bowels of my new home, deep within the legendary mountains of madness, where I would lie in wait, for the coming of the wizards, of whom I would consume most heartily.\</p><p>\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\slmult1\qj\partightenfactor0</p><p>\cf2 \strokec2 \</p><p>}</p>
