<p>DREAMS OF MORPHEUS </p><p>Thoughts emanating through my mind. Words fly high above my head. They chirp and trill like colourful hummingbirds in the summer sun. I invite them to perch upon my hand so that I may see them better and divine a description; a recipe to explain to humankind, those elusive but intoxicating utterings of the gods. Somehow these hummingbirds remain evanescent, just beyond the tip of my brain; fluttering, beautiful, glowing with otherworldly warmth of the god that created them. I feel their power, pure energy encased in a colourful shell that defines shape and form. I observe the gentle appearance of the word-hummingbird in my hand, I feel it's latent power pulsating with a dull resonance that courses through my body. Inspired, I capture the essence of this beautiful creature; a photograph in my mind that connects my soul to the mind of a god who created this hummingbird. I sit back slowly enjoying the connection, his strength fills my brain with ideas so beautiful, alongside strange conceptions of terror and torment. A wonderful dichotomy of pleasure, fear and pain; I yearn to gather more word-hummingbirds. I must find a way to communicate the divine from my mind, to my world. </p><p>My friend and I over a bottle of wine, that divine gift of Bacchus to the mortal realms, found together we were soon able to define those elusive musings into a tapestry of word-hummingbirds. And so, as in Ancient Greece, we became an ‘oracle' of the gods. Now I feel the gentle ‘whisperings' tip-tapping at my soul.  The word-hummingbirds form together into tales and stories so perfect I'm brimming with ecstasy. As the stories flow into my mind's reservoir, the god quietly introduces himself; he is the immortal god of sleep and dreams, Morpheus. </p><p>My friend and I have often spoken collectively about the ‘dreams of Morpheus' and so have brought these magical tales together; as a modern ‘Oracle' we unite these wondrous thoughts and ideas for you. Some bring joy, some dread and fear. None will leave you the same. These tales may be enjoyed anywhere, at any time. Perhaps you too are toasting Bacchus, or you might be preparing to meet Morpheus through the divine medium of ‘sleep'. Remember do not read these words lightly, for beware, ‘those whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad'. </p><p>Paul Harris and M.J. Hewitt, January 2019 </p>
