<p>GARGOYLE</p><p>Emerald eyes burning holes through my soul, </p><p>Feelings of watching creeping terror. </p><p>Stone heart standing out of sight. </p><p>Evil spirits flee, jagged fingernails ripe with deceit prizing secrets from my eyes. </p><p>Secrets drop from my mind like beads of sweat from my nose. </p><p>Mushrooms of Angel dust reaped from the depths of Beltane hues. </p><p>A dagger of burning truth steals a kiss. </p><p>Ripping through my chest, exposing the expanse of my desire. </p><p>Angel heart, burning fire, cauterising flesh, Sin destroyed. </p><p>Fear and torment petrified.</p>
