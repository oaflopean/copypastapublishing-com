<p>DEMON DREAMS   </p><p>A piece for you. A piece for your friend.</p><p>Taste my brain, taste my essence and dream.</p><p>Dream of the darkness, </p><p>Dream of the demons that plague me, </p><p>Dream of the demons that torture me, </p><p>That remorselessly piss on my grave.</p><p>Taste my brain, </p><p>Taste my pain, </p><p>Taste the shit that pumps around my very being.</p><p>That's my star, the one that shines blood red. </p><p>Cut it open with jagged knife. </p><p>Let it bleed and pull me free</p><p>From the umbilical threaded cord of dying stars.</p><p>And let me fly, </p><p>Let me be free. </p><p>But please don't let the demons dance with me,</p><p>Don't let them court me, and don't let them piss on my grave.</p><p>And as I vomit my forgiveness into your hands, you smile, </p><p>You smile your crooked smile, your hungry smile, and you devour me. </p><p>You devour my body, </p><p>You devour my soul,</p><p>And finally but most satisfyingly, </p><p>You devour the demons that darkly squirm from </p><p>Within me in a stinking, slime ridden wave of fear.</p>
