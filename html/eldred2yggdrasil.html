<p>ELDRED: 2. YGGDRASIL </p><p>Side by side they sat beneath the ancient tree known locally as Yggdrasil. Four young women, each one naked, their blonde hair cascading in waves down their backs, almost covering their full breasts. They gently rocked to and thro in the summer breeze.  Riding the breeze, the stench of battle, death and defeat. They stared with clear blue eyes at the gnarled branches that appeared to reach towards them with greedy and grasping intent, searching for a youth long lost.  Their faces impassive, their lips moving in unison as guttural incantations drifted from them.  Their chants grew louder and louder, their breasts heaving with passion. Leaves began to float gently down upon them momentarily covering their nakedness. Twisting and turning over and over waves of luscious green flowed. Their palms fell open, letting the leaves slowly and gently nestle.   Once their small hands were full of leaves their chanting ceased and the leaves fell no longer. </p><p> </p><p>As one, they turned away from the tree and faced together the carnage of battle.  Fields and fields of men lay dead where they fell.  The battle had ended some time ago all that now remained was a landscape of corpses, some still moving slowly, some groaning, some begging for death to release them from their broken bodies.  The women moved forward, pale faced and impassive they began slowly to weave through the mounds of bodies their hands gently caressing the rent flesh and smearing blood stained fingers upon their torsos down to the place between their legs which tingled with anticipation.  Colours resonating around them, bright tunics, standards that still fluttered in the breeze bearing standards of red and white crosses, Eagles and raging bears. </p><p>Eventually the young women arrived at their destination which lay by the side of a trickling brook. Here rested the body of the slain Prince. His handsome face still and pale, his eyes wide as if trying to take with him a last long image of the world he had been ruthlessly torn away from.  A huge axe embedded in his chest exposed his internal organs to the gaze of the women standing before him. Swiftly the four women began to place the gathered leaves upon the Prince's face and his chest which no longer rose and fell with the breath of life.  They gathered around his body and once again they began to chant, grunting and groaning with passion and ecstasy their hands, breasts and thighs rubbing against his face and chest. The leaves began to smoke and smoulder before them, small flickering flames in waves beginning to envelop the entire length of the Prince's body. His tunic was now fully a blaze with waves of flame caressing his golden locks, the flames not destroying him but restoring him.  His chest began to close, the flames cauterised his wounds, healing them with the heat of fire. His ripped throat was welded together and the sound of incoherent words flowed from his parched lips.  With these utterances the young enchantresses began to weep, their tears extinguishing the flames. When all the flames had gone and life flowed freely through his body, they brought him water from the brook, he drank greedily from their cupped hands, gulping down the clear water.   </p><p>After some time once his strength restored, the women helped Prince Eldred to his feet, he stared with disbelief at his friends and family that lay dead all around him. His heart hurt with the sight of such barbarism, and thoughts of revenge surged through him.  He arched his back screaming at the distant red star where the strange adversaries had retreated. Cursing the gods which had brought such misfortune upon him and he swore to slay the perpetrators of these evil deeds.  Several moments passed as he staggered beneath the heavy weight of grief until he realised the women were now tugging at his Emerald tunic and removing his lower garments. They began to chant louder and louder as they grasped his manhood. He gasped with a depth of intense pleasure as he entered them one after the other, his life force growing with every thrust.  Their incantations increased in volume and urgency as he reached his climax. A golden glowing orb emanated from each woman, rising from her glistening body each rapidly circled high above and plummeted down upon the Prince entering his nose and open mouth as he cried in ecstasy. His life force was fully returned. As his cries subsided silence fell like a blanket upon him.</p><p>The women beckoned to him to follow them quickly. \"Follow us\" they whispered, \"follow us to the tree of life, where your journey will truly begin, it wants to lead you to the light\" they whispered, \"to the light\".  With that they began to sing, and it was the sweetest song the Prince had ever heard, they held his hands gently and slowly together in a circle they began to rise from the ground. Spinning around together as they floated across the fields, hand in hand, high above the carnage that lay below them, they drifted back towards the dark gnarled branches of the ancient tree.   </p><p>They came to rest on one of the higher branches of the tree. The Prince staring with wide eyes in awe of the event that had just taken place. His body shaking with life and residual sexual energy, he turned to look at the four naked women before him with a renewed hunger, but to his disbelief they had risen again from the branches, but this time as pure white doves. They had transformed the moment they had touched the tree.  They circled around him looking beautiful in their flight. \"Come back\" Eldred called to them, \"Come back, who are you? I owe you my life!\" The birds ignored his pleas continuing their circling of the tree where he was perched. </p><p>Prince Eldred attempted to climb down from the tree, but his whole body appeared to be stuck to its branches, it clung to him like a desperate lover, immobilised he could not move. His heart thumped hard within him and a cold sweat seeped across his brow.  He began to shout and scream in panic, \"What infernal magic is this? I demand you release me; do you hear?\" As these last words left his lips he could feel the tree begin to shake, a violent shaking that came from somewhere deep underground, the vibrations flowing right through his body, sending bile rushing and gurgling into his throat. The ground surrounding the bottom of the tree began to stir, writhing in thick, undulating waves as the tree began an assent back into the ground out of which it had grown many, many hundreds of years before. </p><p>Down and down into the ground it withdrew, like a sword withdrawing into its sheath, as if time was reversing the tree once again returned to the state of a young sapling, but its grip remained iron strong.  The Prince's mouth fell open aghast and helpless at what was happening as his entire body slowly disappeared into the yielding, welcoming, famished ground. </p><p>He desperately screamed out to the gods to help him. Dragged by the young shoot he travelled deeper and deeper under the soil and his words soon became muffled. Quicker and quicker down and down a dank and cloying darkness all around him. He held onto his breath, keeping his mouth and eyes firmly shut as he continued his journey through the soil of his homeland. Desperate for a breath of life-sustaining air that so recently had been returned to him, he was dragged into the seed of the once ancient tree, his body was pulled with inhuman force into the darkness of the seed shell. Once it had captured its prey the seed began to seal itself, imprisoning him in an ever deeper darkness.</p><p>The Prince beat his hands hard against the insides of the seed shell, desperate for escape from the darkness that lay around him, but with no success. Dispirited, he collapsed and strangely within a matter of moments he had drifted off into a deep sleep.  </p><p>In his dream he was surrounded once again by the beautiful women who had brought him back from death, but this time they did not look so beautiful, for when their faces turned toward him, they possessed dark coloured tongues which began to grow and slide thickly from their drooling mouths.  Their tongues had taken on the form of serpents which swept to and thro before him spewing out liquid which splashed in waves against his body.  He couldn't move as the liquid covered him, it drenched him and paralysis ruled his body as the liquid seeped into him, bubbling and leaking into his very being.  After a few moments he could feel a rising with in him, suddenly a surge of something which felt like skittering bugs forcing their way out of his mouth in a spurt of darkness.   The dark skittering beings now floated about him and they had the appearance of colourful birds but each and every one of them possessed a face not unlike his own. Miserable faces, miniature caricatures of himself, mocking and sneering. He tried to back away from their mirth as it hurt his soul, but there was no escape from them as they floated and danced around him in hordes.  The women with their tongues still lolling, flicked their tongues towards these strange floating creatures capturing them on the stickiness of their tongues, pulling them into their smiling mouths, groaning and savouring as they consumed them.  With each swallowing their bodies began to grow, swelling grossly before the Prince, this was a grotesque sight which filled him with a deeper fear. Larger and larger they became until there was no room for Eldred to breathe as the fat of the young women's bodies began to suffocate him, pinning him to the wall of the seed. He tried to bite at the flesh before him but there was just too much of it, and in time he grew weak and tears stung his eyes as began to breathe his last.                  </p><p>Abruptly, deeply sobbing and gasping for breath he came out of his dream finding that there were tears spilling down his cheeks, tears for himself, tears for the fate of himself within his dream. His tears were unstoppable as they spilt down his face dripping off his chin in large globules.  After some time still weeping he began to feel something strangely shifting beneath his crumpled body, something small stirring beneath him, and with a shaking, furtive hand he groped below himself to find out what this strange object was.  It felt soft to touch and he could feel it's size ever increasing, pushing its way around his body, beginning to embrace him in its grip. His body began to actually feel like it was being lifted upwards towards the seed wall that cocooned him. He braced his arms for fear that he would be crushed against the inner shell, his arms were pressed with great force against the walls of the seed, until with an almighty crack, a surge of soil poured upon him and he was once again journeying through the ground in the embrace of the incredibly strong appendage that held him tight.  He screamed with terror as his journey through the soil sped up to a point where what remained of his clothes were literally being torn from his body. Strangely though and on an incomprehensible level he wondered to himself why he was not suffocating or being crushed beneath the sheer volume and weight of the soil. But this was only a fleeting thought and there was no answer to it, as he cut through the soil and exploded out of the ground in an eruption of debris. </p><p>...</p><p>Prince Eldred opened his eyes and was greeted by a strange sight for everything that surrounded him was coloured red.  The soil that lay about him, the trees that swayed in the near distance and even the sky itself glowed red.  He looked down at his naked body for signs of damage from his journey, but remarkably could not see any signs of damage.  Slowly he rose to his feet and made his way to the edge of a large pit which rumbled and spat out leaping red flames from within.  At the bottom of the gaping pit he could make out a familiar form, the form of the enormous, bulbous headed elemental that he was sure he had slain with poison in battle. It lay within the red flames in all its glory.  The flames caressing the being, not destroying it, but loving its body within the red pyre. Anger bubbled up within the Prince as his mind filled with thoughts of vengeance for his friends, family and comrades who had been slain.   The Prince desperately looked around for some sort of weapon so that he could slay the monster once and for all before it awoke from its slumber. His mind was drawn to the beautiful sword, wondering what had become of this. However, the only possible weapon he could set his hands upon was a large rock stationed a few meters from the pit.  </p><p>Naked he made his way over to where the stone lay, placing his muscular arms around it. After much effort he managed to heave the rock up to the level of his belly and he began a slow staggering journey towards the pit and vengeance.  After much grunting and growling he made it at last to the rim of the pit as once again he stared down at the hideous abomination that lay below him.   Anger seethed through his body as he slowly pushed the huge rock closer to the edge and just as he was about to place all of his weight behind a final push of the rock a high pitched voice emanated from above him ‘Stop Prince, why would you want to murder your brother?' </p><p>These very words froze Prince Eldred in his tracks.  After several moments of contemplation, the Prince lifted his head and looked up at the speaker of these words.  Above him hovered one elemental, a small one at that, probably only the size of a mere grasshopper.  It floated above him glimmering, in its hand it held a tiny sword, which must not have been much heftier than a match stick.   \"Prince, he is your brother, I can prove this to you, follow me.\" The Prince stared at the elemental aghast by this ludicrous notion. \"Be gone or you will die also, he will be slain he murdered my people, my people, do you hear me, and now he will die!\" roared the Prince. </p><p>‘Stop!!' the elemental spoke again, much more forcefully this time ‘I will tell you more'.  'You belong to us now, you are our kin, your wives and blood children they await you'   The Prince fell backwards away from the pit due to the sheer power of these spoken words.  \"No, this cannot be, you lie!\" Shouted the Prince. \"Well, let me show you then, just follow me, and I will prove to you the very justness of my words\" </p><p>Begrudgingly, leaving the rock perched at the side of the pit the Prince in a state of disbelief due to the unholy words spoken by the elemental began to follow its twirling and fluttering flight path away from the side of the pit. </p><p>After scaling steep rouge coloured slopes for what seemed like an age, they arrived at the entrance of a cave which hummed with activity emanating from deep within its glowing red interior. \"Prince, I can go no further, for this is the Cavern of the Royals, and I must not enter this  domain, here your family awaits you!\" With these parting words the elemental disappeared in the blink of an eye leaving the Prince standing naked and alone at the very entrance of the cave.  </p><p>Prince Eldred still disbelieving the elemental, slowly entered into the cave, his body appeared to gleam with bright scarlet.   </p><p>Fearing that he had been led into a cunning trap, the Prince found a sharp stick nearby, not a glorious sword, but still a handy weapon he grasped it tightly in his hand wishing that he had somehow managed to keep hold of the beautiful sword, but it was lost.   Gingerly he followed the humming which seemed to emanate from somewhere deep within the bowels of the cave, sweat dampened his hands and his breathing became deeper and more laboured as he prepared himself for some kind of assault from whatever lived within the cave. </p><p>After sometime though, there was still no assault forthcoming and the Prince became more focussed on where the humming was emanating from. After a few moments he reached a small tunnel that branched off from the open part of the cave he was now in. As he entered the passage he realised that the humming was definitely coming from within as it was becoming much louder.  The tunnel was really narrow in places and the Prince had to squeeze his way through, painfully scraping skin from his naked body.  This became an arduous task physically and psychologically for the Prince as more and more thoughts skipped through his mind regarding what he would find waiting at the end of the tunnel?  Was the elemental lying? Was this a trap? What was awaiting him? One thing was for sure the Prince would show his bravery, he would not be seen as a coward and he would face his assailants, he would destroy them and then return to the pit to seek vengeance. He would kill them all with his bare hands.  </p><p>Eventually, there was a steady change in the light ahead, from a dull red glow to once again a brighter blood red as he approached which could only be the end of the tunnel.  As he stepped out of the tunnel he grasped hard onto the sharp stick ready for any sudden attack, but once again no attack took place as he moved into the open space before him.    </p><p>The Prince abruptly stopped in his tracks, he was stunned by the sight that lay ahead and a cold shiver ran through his entire body.  He had never felt fear and confusion like he was feeling now, his brain struggling to understand and process what lay in the deep cavern before him.   Lines upon lines of small gleaming elementals filled the cavern from one side to the other all of them facing away from him towards three ruby bevelled thrones which stood side by side on an incline close to the far wall of the cave.  Their wings humming gently in unison.</p><p>He could not move, he could only stare in disbelief as three larger elementals took their places on the thrones. In a place deep within his being he suddenly understood all that had gone before, not consciously but somewhere on an innate level he got it, he now understood every twist and turn of the last few days and it sickened him.</p><p>For he had been tricked into mating with the three hideous elementals that now sat before him, the three who had previously masqueraded as lifesaving angels and shone with a pure beauty now gleamed only with a dark evil.  They had brought him back from death for only one reason, and that reason was to breed, to help sire a new royal race a race of half human half elemental, evidence of which was now lined up in row upon row before him.                   </p><p>Open mouthed and weeping uncontrollably, he fell to his knees, sobs bursting from him echoing and mixing with the gentle humming sounds that came from his spawn.   </p><p>All of a sudden as if disturbed and agitated by his sobs one by one they turned to face him.  </p><p>Hundreds upon hundreds of faces just like his own now stared upon him, smaller and rounder in shape with lolling tongues, they slowly began to unfurl their amber wings more fully and the humming sound grew louder as they readied themselves for flight.  </p><p>\"Attack!!!!\" the three Queens shouted in unison, the spawn of the Prince as one great force now began to fly towards their father, they wanted only to butcher him, destroy him, for he was not of their kind and his job had been done. His royal blood now pumped around their tiny bodies. For they were a new more powerful race, a race far, far more superior than before. After the Prince had been butchered they would return to King Slyph, and they would lift him from his resting place in the red pyre, so that he could lead them back into battle, and this time it would be a battle that they would surely win.  For this time, it was not purely to capture a city but to conquer the entire country. For the weak little humans would fall to their knees and be humbled by a new more powerful race of the long forgotten crimson land of Slyph. </p>
