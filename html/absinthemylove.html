<p>ABSINTHE MY LOVE</p><p>Eyes that swoon and sway, </p><p>Mind stolen by hardship and pain.</p><p>Thoughts flit and float just beyond grasp on the tip of my brain.</p><p>I focus on hope but clarity evaporates like a wraith at sunrise. </p><p>Red pyre burning bright, leaves shrivel and crackle in moonlight, </p><p>Mouth poised with anticipation. </p><p>Absinthe coats my throat freeing my mind with pleasure. </p><p>The emerald fairy flirts and flies</p><p>Taunting me with glimpses of divine obscurity.</p><p>Heavenly droplets bead and run in rivulets to my soul</p><p>Lifting my spirits with every draught;</p><p>My tongue loosens the fettles of reality, </p><p>Every flavour unleashing torrents of thoughts awakening my mind</p><p>Seasoning perception with perfection.</p><p>My heart gloating, steeped in blissful eccentricity</p><p>Pulse racing, ideas coursing in streams before my minds eye.</p><p>I am immortal! None may touch me!!!</p><p>I growl and roar like a man possessed </p><p>Eyes bulging, heart racing, chest heaving</p><p>My life's spark leaves my throat, soars higher and higher past the clouds into the void beyond.</p>
