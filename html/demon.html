<p>DEMON</p><p>Leathery-winged </p><p>Gleaming, sapphire blue eyes </p><p>Wicked, dagger-like teeth ideal for ripping and tearing </p><p>Hooked talons coated with a sticky, scarlet-coloured substance </p><p>Fur the colour of night. </p><p>Behold for here before you stands Satan's subject</p><p>A beast of your darkest dreams. </p><p>So sleep sleep and no need to search</p><p>For here the demon will sit before you</p><p>Coated in a glorious robe of grandeur.</p>
