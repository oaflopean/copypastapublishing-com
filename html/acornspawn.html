<p>ACORN'S SPAWN</p><p>The crooked hunched up old man staggered towards the entrance of the cave, an arduous task for a man of such age and fragility. It was very true that his days of youth were well past, but he could still feel the heat of a raging fire that burnt brightly and painfully within his ancient heart. A fire that could never be dampened, a fire that had now spread to his mind, setting it alight with a curiosity of what lay ahead. Oh the wonderful anticipation of youth and power was intoxicating. He felt light headed as he stood at the cave entrance, it smelt dank, and a heavy earthy smell filled his nostrils forcing him to gag. There was something else, he sensed something ancient and malevolent inside. Is this it? Is it really here? He thought to himself as a sinister smile spread across his dry lips. His heart swelled with excitement. \"I must be careful\", he said under his breath failure would seal his fate to eternal torment. Gingerly he entered, a mixture of excitement and fear bubbling within him, he began chanting loudly in an ancient tongue un-uttered for a millennia, hoping with all his heart that at last he could recapture something that he had dreamed of since he had been a child. He was prepared to risk his life for a taste of being adored and worshipped like the god he saw himself as truly being.</p><p>As his mantra echoed around the cave, the heaviness lifted slightly as if the very atmosphere was listening to his words, then suddenly it returned with an explosion, pinning him painfully to the floor of the cave. He raised his voice again guttural chants imperiously resonating within the darkness, a mixture of anger and trepidation filled his soul. He scrabbled around on the dirty floor, trying to lift his feeble body. Trying to summon up the strength to climb to his feet, but the sheer force of the explosion had virtually drained him of all his remaining strength. Instead though, he managed to use his feet to slowly push himself backwards, so that after a hugely strenuous effort his back was now propped up against the damp cave wall.</p><p>The great force that lay in the darkness before him had grown silent, but he could still sense its brooding presence. So once again he raised his voice, but louder this time, as his eyes rolled to the back of his head he chanted some of the most ancient magical words he could remember. Within an instant there was a further explosion, which literally shook the walls and bright streams of light poured forth in waves, pulsating with a strength he had never seen before, the old man had to cover his eyes due to the incredible power of the light. He gasped involuntarily as the magnitude of the situation tore at his soul with clawed barbs. After a few moments silence reigned, but the bright pulsing light continued, his head throbbed with the deafening silence surrounding him.</p><p>He slowly regained his composure as tentatively he peered through his laced fingers at the wall of the cave that lay directly in front him, and was stunned by the precise writings which covered the surface.</p><p>They were ancient runes, words that filled his mind, and deafened his senses; he rubbed his eyes in disbelief as the words and sentences unfolded on the cave wall before him. </p><p>\"Saviour, our Saviour Baliel. We have waited so long, so long!  At last you have come to reunite us, set us free. Make us strong again Anointed One! Make us strong! The evil one  separated us, weakened us, tormented and drained us of all our greatness. And now we are imprisoned, I within this suffocating earth, and my brother within the depths of the molten fire which everlastingly burns. Bring us together, so that we are the Angel of Death once again and eternal greatness and immortality will be yours, powerful Master! Release me now O'Great One and I will grant you the sweetness of immortality, release my brother from the pit of fire and you will be granted what you seek. You will be a god! We will make you all powerful, feared, adored and worshipped oh great and glorious Master!!!\"</p><p>Suddenly silence and darkness reigned once more throughout the cave; the old man slowly slid his trembling, grimy fingers from his eyes.  He could see nothing apart from the pale light from the cave entrance. He crawled forwards his mind in turmoil due to the enormity of the information he had received but which had been shut off in an instant as the darkness had abruptly returned to the cave. Eventually he reached the far wall of the cave where he thought the written words had been etched. But to his disbelief the wall felt smooth under his fingertips. He moved his open palms up and down the rock searching for the words, searching for the next clue which would help him on his journey towards immortality and greatness. He was getting desperate. </p><p>Hot tears of defeat were trickling from Baliel's eyes when a  rumbling sound came from the darkness deep below the cave. He stopped abruptly, letting his body slide down the cave wall, he rested on his haunches, slowly curling himself into a foetal ball in fear of this new sound which was rapidly getting closer and closer to him. He peered into the darkness and his weary eyes suddenly picked out a vast shape travelling low across the cave floor.  It glowed a pure white in the darkness, it seemed to be shining from the inside out, it was its sheer length that stunned him as he still could not see the end of its snake-like body as it moved rapidly over the rocks. </p><p>His body was frozen with fear, he could not manage any movement as his heart banged within his feeble body, and he felt that his heart would surely explode as the abomination came to a sudden halt in front of his curled up form. His eyes widened in terror at the sight of serpent's tongue which was as long on its own as any ordinary snake, it flicked in and out of its hideous jaw. The old man was shaking as the serpent's hot breath blasted into his face, a stench worse than rotting flesh knotted his stomach. It was breathing hard as soft words began to emanate from somewhere deep down within its body. \"My Lord, my Lord, listen\". \"Be calm now for I am your guide, I am Hydra and I wish to deliver you to the light my Lord\". The old man pushed himself back further into the unyielding cave wall. \"Be calm, I wish to lead you to the light, take my hand\".  Slowly the serpent's huge jaw opened and a small pale arm appeared; the hand with delicate fingers beckoning to the old man, reaching for him with an open palm. The old man suddenly felt a calmness flow through his body, as the small hand waved within the darkness before him, I am surely under a spell he thought to himself in his befuddled mind as he reached out towards the hand. He slowly entered into the serpent's mouth. Crawling into the bright light that glowed from within. He peered up into the eyes of a strange creature that now held him in a strong embrace and was struck by the orange glow in its slit eyes. It's face and body were that of a pure opaque white and only the top half of it's body moved freely as the bottom half was welded, like a thick fleshy branch to the innards of the serpent. In fact he recognised that it was one with the serpent. \"We travel, sleep O' Lord as a long perilous journey lies before you\", the creature hissed. And in a drugged state the old man slumped into a deep sleep.   </p><p>...</p><p>Hydra travelled rapidly, deeper and deeper into the bowels of the earth, passing many abominations and peculiar sights that human eyes would never see or understand, until eventually coming to rest in a clearing which pulsed with incredibly bright bursts of light. Once Hydra had come to rest, its inner-self gently reached over with one of its small hands, touching softly the closed eyelids of the old man. And in an instant his eyes opened. And once again he felt an incredible calmness sweep through him as the slitted eyes of the creature met his. He felt a connection, a tugging deep in his mind when thoughts as strong as spoken words began to materialise within his mind. \"Here is the light my Lord, go to the light, free it from its imprisonment as the first part of your quest. Go now and be strong.\"</p><p>With the words of Hydra still resonating within his brain the old man crawled out from the mouth of the serpent. Flashes of light becoming even more intense, as he crawled forth. He slithered on his belly with a new-found skill, he moved with ease on his belly into the clearing where the light pulsed so brightly.  Resting before him in the centre of the clearing was the source of the light, oval in shape, flashing with waves of bright light that seemed to oscillate, circulating and sloshing around within the egg like shape.  Still feeling calm he slid and crawled towards it, loosening his dagger within its scabbard.  He felt no fear, only determination and calmness as the hissing words of Hydra once again became loud and clear within his essence. </p><p>\"Rise up my Lord, pierce the skin, release the light and immortality will be yours!\" With these last words, Baliel hurled himself towards the oval shape, slashing at its walls with his dagger.  </p><p>An enormous eruption of sound and glowing whiteness poured forth from the egg, waves and waves of tiny skittering spider-like insects fell upon him, lifting him up like a rag doll on a wave of whiteness, tossing him around the cave.  Shrieking sounds emanating from his lips, as if the very demons of hell had been released, echoed back and forth bouncing off the cave walls as the ground rumbled and cracked, huge ragged fissures appearing throughout the cave.  The small glowing insects entered him in waves tearing at his flesh painfully, gushing through his every orifice pinning him to the floor of the cave as they became one with him.</p><p>He felt a new strength.  His whole body, even though aged throbbed with a new inner strength.  Immortality at last was his and he whooped and cackled with laughter that echoed back and forth around the cave.  He could feel the small insects that had entered his body skittering around within him, up and down the insides of his throat and around his stomach and guts. He liked the feeling; it was warm and filled him with happiness.  He knew that the insects possessed a power far greater than any he could ever possess and he also knew that this was truly his first step towards greatness as a piece of the great Angel of Death now held sanctuary within him. He felt clear headed, no longer angry, he knew what he had to do and how to do it. It was going to be a challenge, but for a man of his power it was definitely achievable.  He remembered the etchings upon the cave wall and realised to himself that now he must journey much deeper into the very molten centre of the earth to find the final part of the Angel of Death. Half of the Angel was now within him, so surely the tasks that lay in front of him would be much easier to achieve.  He had immortality and he was hungry to be acclaimed as a god.  But he would only be granted divinity once he had managed to reunite both pieces of the Angel of Death.  Baliel sat in the darkness and waited. He had no idea how long he had been in this same spot and to be honest it really didn't matter.  All that mattered to Baliel was awareness, awareness of a sign.  Any sign which could lead him onto the next part of his journey.  He now possessed a new found patience, and he was happy to wait. </p><p>...</p><p>No one but Baliel knew of what he had witnessed as a child. Scenes that were etched upon his mind ultimately led him on this journey towards immortality and divinity. No one knew of his secret.    </p><p>Baliel as a child, was of the inquisitive kind.  So much so that he would often sit alone for what seemed like hours  within the gloomy  woods, listening to the birds, listening hard for any sound that could heighten his childish curiosity.   On this particular spring morning Baliel was sat in his favourite spot in a small clearing, perched on the gnarled roots of a  locally famous oak tree. The tree was famous in the small village that Baliel grew up in, a fame shrouded in mystery and gloom.  The story of the ‘tree' was read to  the children of the village when they had misbehaved as a kind of  punishment, it was known in the story as the ‘child-eating tree'.    All the story did to Baliel was make him even more curious.  It was said that when a child disobeyed or misbehaved towards his or her parents that the roots of the child-eating tree would seek out the child, firstly strangling and then dragging them under the ground, where eventually they would be deposited into their final resting place deep within the dark hollow of the tree for all eternity.   </p><p>This particular morning Baliel for around the fiftieth time was running through this same story of the tree in his own mind, searching for a shred of fear to assist him out of his boredom, when he was pulled  out of his thoughts by what sounded like the muffled cries of a child.  Baliel realises to his disbelief that a child's whimpering was emanating from the trunk of the tree itself.  With his whole body shivering from a mixture of fear and excitement coursing through his body, he tottered over to the trunk of the tree known as the ‘child-eating tree'.  He gingerly placed his ear against the rough bark, pressing hard against it.  As soon as his ear touched the tree, Baliel felt a peculiar dizziness and in an instant became completely unconscious.   When he came back to his senses  he found himself surrounded by heaps of lifeless children.  Stacked high, laid in lines, pale, lifeless and completely silent.    </p><p>...</p><p>Totally dismayed by his situation Baliel suddenly realised that he was now within the tree itself.  But how could this be? A world lying within a tree?  Still in shock he staggered to his feet and recognised that the children were laid out in shapes.  A line of children before him was laid out in the shape of a pale fleshy shaped arrow.  And then a long line of children that reminded him of a trail of breadcrumbs went well off into the distance and up towards a small tower perched darkly on the very top of a hill of smooth, shining  oakwood.    Something drew Baliel towards this strange tower and he scurried forth.</p><p>Not so scared but more excited, Baliel arrived at the front door of the tower.  Baliel gently pushed against the large door and it  creaked open, a stench wafted over Baliel from the inside.  Tentatively he moved into a large room with immense arched ceilings.  A wide open room lay before him and in the centre lay an immense oblong shaped table gleaming brightly of what appeared to be a white marble.  In the centre of the table lay a tiny child. The child was humming gently to itself as Baliel moved towards it. When Baliel had reached the side of the table he heard a scurrying from high above and to his horror he could now make out in the gloom many large dark stick-like insects writhing down the walls towards him.    A dark wave of strange slithering stick insects descended upon him paralysing his body with sticky venom which they squirted from all angles. </p><p>Baliel couldn't move, but he could still see and he could indeed comprehend a chattering emanating from these creatures; strangely enough it was a chattering he could understand, a dream like chanting, \"wait until your seventieth year, on your seventieth year you may become immortal and walk as a god upon this stinking earth, the child will awake and lead you to greatness. ‘Acorn' will slowly awake within you and lead you to  the great one named the ‘Angel of Death' where you will free him from his captivity. Your reward will be to become an  immortal  god! Listen, this must remain a secret or the weight of the world will fall upon thee!\" </p><p>The words and images of that strange day so long ago still moved through Baliel's mind, crystal clear.  At the time, Baliel thought it had all been a very odd, incredibly realistic dream, as the next thing he realised was that he was back at home tucked up in bed. But shortly afterwards as time drifted by, he began to hear a child's voice in his head, he realised then that something unexplainable had happened to him that day. The child announced itself as ‘Acorn' and Baliel in an instant thought back to his strange experience within the child-eating tree, which he had initially dismissed as nothing more than a dream. As the years went by ‘Acorn' spoke more often to Baliel reminding him to hold on to his secret.  ‘Acorn' would constantly remind Baliel that immortality and godship were worth waiting for and as his seventieth year was approaching Acorn began to provide him with more and more detail regarding his journey towards greatness. </p><p>Eventually Baliel's patience paid off, as once again he could  hear the shrill familiar voice of Acorn emerging from the depths of his psyche. The Angel of Death however, strangely fell silent within him. Baliel listened intently to the directions of Acorn as he rose from his sitting position and began to follow with an inhuman speed. Down into the bowels of the earth, with haste with high velocity he descended. Darkness and stifling heat surrounded him but he felt no fear, he felt no pain  from the increasing heat that enveloped him. This way, that way, left, right, the orders from Acorn poured forth from his psyche.   Until in a scream that reverberated around his head, Acorn shouted \"halt!\"At that precise moment a surge of excitement blasted through Baliel's body. \"At last I am here,\" he thought to himself, \"at last the final part of the jigsaw is within my grasp. I am moments from becoming a god amongst men!\" For the first time on this latest part of his journey, Baliel began to look around himself taking in the oddness of his new destination, for the rest of the journey had been nothing more than a blur as he had speeded towards this destination with an inhuman speed.  Baliel to his total disbelief was now standing in the centre of a very large well lit Great Hall.  Grand chandeliers hung down from the high ceilings, and paintings adorned the walls, paintings that each displayed a familiar image, they showed different  depictions of the great snake Hydra.   </p><p>Standing before him, less than twenty feet or so away from his gaping, shocked face stood a court jester, who silently juggled three swords. A smug expression decorated his cherub like face. A huge open fire raged directly behind him, casting whirling shadows around the walls and ceiling of the vast Hall. Open mouthed Baliel slowly moved toward the jester who continued with great speed and agility to juggle his three blades. \"Halt!\" Acorn screamed once again within the Psyche of Baliel. ‘This is the final guard, the gatekeeper of the great magicians, defeat him and you will have finally reached the ultimate phase of the ‘god-making' which rests within the deepest part of the very fire that rages before thee, but beware of the swords, for one of these was the very blade that cleaved into two pieces, the mighty Angel of Death. Magic pulses within them, you may be immortal, but these swords can destroy immortality.\"</p><p>More tentatively now, Baliel began to try to step around the jester whose expression remained totally unchanged; ‘Let me pass' Baliel croaked.  The jester, as if not hearing, stared straight through Baliel with a fixed stare. To Baliel's frustration each time he tried to pass, the jester moved swiftly to block his path, the only sound being the razor sharp swords, whirring as they cut through the air.  After several unsuccessful attempts,  Baliel ground to a halt, for he could not think of anyway of bypassing the jester.  Then to his amazement he suddenly noticed a movement in the corner of his eye.  A movement within the paintings that adorned the walls of the Hall.  The paintings began to become more life-like, bubbling in their frames, stretching and forming into more solid structures.  The jester paid no attention to this phenomenon, only Baliel's eyes open-wide beheld the amazing changes taking place, as many small versions of the snake Hydra slithered ever so silently and gently down the walls, very alive now, paintings no more. Around the juggling jester's feet they gathered, his smug expression remaining unchanged as they tightened their grip around his legs.   Five of them in total slithered up the jester's body towards his unchanged cherub like face. </p><p>Recognising the opportunity unfolding before him, Baliel rapidly made a dash for the raging fire and in an instant he had successfully passed the jester, the only sight now was the flames, the only sound now was the blood-curdling scream and keening noise which echoed all around the Great Hall from behind him.  But about none of this he cared, as the images of himself being deified flooded his mind. Baliel in an instant leapt into the flames, eyes wide seeking out the final part of the Angel of Death which would bring him divinity.  Baliel waded forward the flames licking his body, embracing him from every angle. A cloak of fire forming around his body a crown of fire adorned his head. He never expected pain as he was aware that immortality was his and so when he witnessed his skin sliding from his body in a thick streaming, bubbling rivulets he firstly felt more shock than physical pain. But soon enough the pain engulfed him, a pain like no other tore through his frail body, \"but I am immortal!\", he screamed and howled as he fell to his knees within the inferno. </p><p>...</p><p>Nothing now but a bubbling mess made up of a mixture of skin and charred bone remained of Baliel.  Strangely, however; movement came from the mound of flesh which was once the hunch that had weighed Baliel down for so many years. The hunch that had grown on Baliel's back over the years since his strange experience within the ‘child-eating tree'.  \"Cut me free!!!! Cut me free!!!!\", the fleshy lump screamed.  </p><p>Beckoned by his master Hydra entered the pyre, bloodied from battle he slithered through the flames to the lump of flesh.  Once at the pulsing mound, Hydra opened his mouth revealing a small slender arm which held forth a bloodied magical dagger.  With a surgeon's skill Hydra began to slice into the fleshy mound. Within moments the one named ‘Acorn' emerged. Wriggling firstly like a newborn he pushed his way through the remaining globules of fat and flesh.  </p><p>A  feeling of rebirth surged through Acorn, all these years waiting for his freedom, all these years of waiting to be in this special place. To be immortal to be a god. Now he was even more determined that the final stages of his journey would be completed.  </p><p>Vengeance! With the thought of vengeance Acorn began to salivate, drooling from his mouth the fires sizzling around him.  He now possessed immortality whilst his host of many years smouldered before him.  \"The gullible fool\", Acorn thought to himself, \"he has served his purpose, he has carried me to my destination.\" With this thought Acorn began to crawl through the flames, immortality as his shield.  </p><p>Being guided purely by instinct with Hydra by his side they eventually came upon a slight clearing in the fire.  In the centre of this clearing stood a burning tree.  A tree which was entirely made of fire, branches, trunk and leaves flickering orange and red, emitting a searing heat. High up and completely surrounded and protected by a blossom of gushing flame, hung two rosy red apples.   </p><p>Acorn knew that this was it, one of these apples was the final prison of the Angel of Death.  At last after such an arduous journey he had reached his destination and with passion and excitement he rushed towards the tree.   </p><p>But to his shock Hydra was much quicker, slithering up through the flames towards the crimson apples.   \"Traitor! How dare you betray me!\" Acorn screamed as Hydra the serpent quickly scaled the burning tree and rapidly gobbled down one of the apples and then waited anxiously and in anticipation for the effects of the apple to begin.  </p><p>Acorn stood for several seconds in shock, mouth wide open as Hydra waited to become god, \"that should be me\", Acorn thought gloomily to himself.  Then with a sudden burst of speed fuelled by rage, Acorn leapt through the flames and rapidly began to climb up and up to where Hydra lay upon the branches of fire, close to the still remaining apple.   </p><p>Virtually within touching distance of Hydra, Acorn came to an abrupt halt, for he became completely mesmerised by the sight that lay before him.  Hydra had begun to rapidly change colours, pink, green, orange, and with each change of colour a gasp from deep inside of Hydra burst forth.  Acorn could only think that Hydra was changing into the god he wanted to be and this was part of the process of change. </p><p>This thought was short lived as Acorn then noticed black liquid beginning to gush and splash from Hydra's mouth. Screams of agony also poured forth from Hydra as he began to thrash around furiously within the flames.  Acorn concluded that Hydra had eaten the wrong fruit and was now dying for his greed. </p><p>With this thought Acorn navigated around the riving body before him and scurried with the speed and agility of a squirrel out onto the branch which held the remaining apple.   Glee bubbled through his body as he reached out for the remaining apple but just as he was moving forward a small hand gripped vice like onto his neck holding him back, holding him tight.  Acorn choking struggled ferociously then fleetingly managed to catch sight of his adversary.  The remains of Hydra clung about him and the tree. Mainly only the insides of Hydra remained, comprising of a bloodied ribcage and one pale fleshy arm which ended in a small but devilishly strong pale hand, that was tightening its grip relentlessly around his neck.   </p><p>With his strength rapidly ebbing away, Acorn grasped for the remaining apple, biting into it, aided  by the very last remnants of his strength.   The very second that the flesh of the apple began to slither down his throat everything about him froze. Frozen in time, flames and smoke stilled, the fingers about his neck stilled.  The only item that did not freeze still was the slow progression of the small bitten off piece of apple travelling down his throat.  Strangely, as if this piece of apple had grown eyes or Acorn had actually manifested himself within it, Acorn could see every step of the journey down his own throat.   Down a dark passage way, twisting, turning and then suddenly bursting out into a vast space flooded with a pale light.  He lay there still for a moment regaining his senses and then realised that his last wish had come true. Around him on every side, stacked high lay pale lifeless children.  Piles upon piles of children torn from their wicked mothers and fathers for just being children, spirited children who were too young to know right from wrong. They had been strangled in their beds and dragged by merciless cursed roots and deposited into the bowels of the child-eating tree.  And here they rested for what was most definitely to be all eternity until the return of Acorn.  </p><p>The god Acorn had returned to free his comrades from their own personal prisons of death. With this thought still resonating around Acorns head, streams of tears began to pour from his bloodshot eyes. As if the darkest clouds had been torn asunder water pooled about Acorn and began to slowly rise and cover the lifeless corpses.  As the water began to soak into their skins one by one they began slowly to revive.  Shaking themselves, brushing their hands down their bodies, becoming aware that life was once again was back within them.      </p><p>...</p><p>After several hours of endless tears flooding from Acorn, all the pale lifeless children had been brought back from the dead.  The final pools of water were now being lapped up by the children, feeding each other, cupping the water in their hands, pouring the essence of their lord down each others thirsty throats.  They were hungry now, not for food but for vengeance. For the scars still remained, psychologically and most definitely physically their eyes bulged, their tongues lolled from their mouths, their necks remained stretched, elongated and cruelly twisted, marked with an array of black bruises.  \"Vengeance!\" they screamed in unison, from out of  all manner of broken necks and throats. \"Vengeance!!!\"</p><p>As evening began to seep over the slumbering town, hordes of deformed children of all shapes and sizes led by Acorn descended upon the residents.  Slicing, cutting, gouging, blood in gallons soon flooded the streets.  Driven by an inhuman rage the children within hours massacred the entire town.  They brought it to its knees.  Curiously only the adults were slaughtered, all children were spared. </p><p>At around midnight of that same day wagons were readied, slowly and systematically being piled high with broken corpses of the entire adult population of the town.  As a punishment the children of the town who had shown some resistance in protecting the evil adults, were utilised as slaves and ordered by Acorn to wheel the heavily laden corpse wagons dripping with gore into the depths of the forest. </p><p>After several days of hard labor the entire population of adults lay slain and piled high within the tree famously known as the ‘child-eating tree' and the town was now entirely populated by laughing, joyful children.</p><p>In time children filtered into the woods, where in unison they prayed, sang and wept around the great tree from which they had been reborn.  A tree that's branches were heavily laden with multitudes of swaying Acorns. </p>
