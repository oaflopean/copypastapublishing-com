<p>FREJA: 2. A FACE OF STONE</p><p>Within the realms of the great castle the beat of the drum ceased and silence reigned within the scarcely lit room.  Only the shallow breathing of the three sorcerers could be heard, but only faintly.  </p><p>The smallest, but only in physical stature, of the sorcerers Abujo, then spoke out. \"It is done brothers, our duty is done and now we should visit Stoneface and demand  our reward.\" The other two solemnly nodded their agreement, \"Yes, as promised we should deliver her vulnerable flesh to the master, the place of everlasting peace, for she has left this world for another and her shell is no longer of use to her and we promised the great one we would deliver her royal body as a sacrifice.\"</p><p>The Princess' body lay as still as a rock, her face as pale as snow, her hair spilling down in gentle waves covering parts of her delicate countenance.</p><p>The sorcerers gently manipulated her cold body into a scratchy hessian sack the top of which they tied a lose knot.  Gently the largest of the sorcerers named Gabada lifted the sack onto his broad shoulders, as the other two helped him towards the narrow doorway which led to a dimly lit flight of stairs.</p><p>Once the sorcerers had negotiated the short vestibule of steps, they entered silently and slowly into the hidden passage way of which only they and the Princess were aware. </p><p>The passage way travelled under a small section of the Castle and then secretly opened up into subterranean caves which lead after a few yards into the dense forest of Shalia.</p><p>Habindo, the third of the sorcerers grinned to himself as they made their way through the darkness of the passage way.  \"The master will be proud of us,\" he gloated;  \"everlasting life will surely be ours\".  The other two nodded in agreement, their faces shining with pleasure and perspiration. The dreadful deed they had committed was going exactly to plan. For they had tricked the Princess purely for the needs of their rather sinister master, 'Stoneface' who now lay in wait for their arrival in the forest. The sorcerers had been promised fair exchange, for a gargantuan reward of immortality.</p><p>It was many moons ago that Abujo had been awoken by the flame spirits.  He thought of them now, their pure beauty, their heat and their great healing power. He recalled the way in which they had danced around his naked prone body, entering him with their fiery tongues cleansing him, planting their message deep within his brain.  \"Bring me the Princess Freyja, I need her, for my lust is overwhelming, bring me the Princess and you and your brothers will be justly rewarded with the paradise of immortality\". </p><p>Abujo remembered how he felt when he heard these words, they filled him with excitement; for immortality had always been something he had dreamt of and yet even his great magical powers could not secure such a gift. </p><p>He remembered then how the flames had rushed out of his prone body and formed a line of fire which led from of his cabin deep into the forest.  He had followed the flame spirits as they burnt a winding trail through the woods.</p><p>Eventually the spirits had led him to a clearing in the forest where the leaves were piled high.  The spirits then set about burning away the leaves, he remembered strongly the strange scents that had filled his senses to overflowing. After a few moments of steady burning he remembered his sense of awe when a stone face was unveiled before his eyes. The stone effigy lay embedded within the soil, unmistakably a face which stared forth towards the heavens with dead, unseeing eyes. But the strangest part was yet to come as the spirit flames gathered around the face and slowly seeped into its stone mouth.  </p><p>Once the flames had completely disappeared, the face gained more elasticity, and Abujo recalled how it had coughed and spluttered for a moment or two before it spoke gently to him. \"Bring me Princess Frejya, feed me her empty shell and with your cunning send her spirit to journey to the other side, where there will be no return. Immortality I will grant you, so go now, make haste for Stoneface is hungry!\" it roared malevolently!</p><p>Their plans had been cunning and more importantly their plans had been successful, lies of love and wealth and greatness had been fed to the Princess on several occasions and she had gobbled them down into her hungry gullible heart.  And now this, Abujo  and his comrades made their way towards the place where Stoneface was waiting silently within the soil of the woods of Shalia to provide them with their long-desired reward of immortality. </p><p>There was a large full blood-red moon and the air was fresh pregnant with expectation, as the sorcerers huddled close together for warmth as they gingerly made their way through the woods.  Beasts moved around within the undergrowth and Abujo had to use his magical powers to craft a shield of safety around them, but on odd occasions, the Synomite beasts managed to wriggle through the shield with their slender small bodies, but only to be stamped on and popped with a spray of fine mist by the powerful feet of Gabada. The Synomites were blood sucking parasites that wriggled with speed and clamped themselves with their short sharp fangs onto any succulent piece of flesh they could get a hold of, where they would suck the blood from their prey with their incredibly powerful suckers that lay precisely placed above their protruding fangs.  Gabada was especially effective at keeping these parasites at bay, much more so than his two older but more feeble comrades.</p><p>Eventually, they arrived at the clearing which was brightly lit by the red moon.  A milky light fell upon the silent Stoneface. With a grunt Gabada gently placed the Princess' body to the ground in its hessian sack and all three of them stared in silence at Stoneface, waiting with nervous anticipation for any sign of life.    </p><p>They did not have to wait for too long; as small rumbling sounds began to emanate from Stoneface's mouth. </p><p>Abujo was the only one who had seen Stoneface speak before; the other two were so shocked by the sounds coming forth from the piece of stone shaped as a grotesque face, that their mouths fell open aghast.</p><p>\"Link hands around my face brothers and immortality will be yours, but firstly bring me my gift!\"</p><p>Eventhough he was in total awe of Stoneface Abujo was a wise sorcerer and not yet completely sure he could trust the strange phenomenon that lay before him. So he spoke out in a shaking voice, \"Master, firstly grant us immortality as you promised and then we shall give you our gift\". Stoneface grumbled inaudibly to himself when he heard these words and after a short time he spoke out again, \"if that be your wish sorcerer, come to me now, stand around me, link your arms and immortality will be yours. But first, at least give me a glimpse of my gift\". </p><p>Abujo nodded to Gabada, and with magical gestures, Gabada began to drag the sack containing the Princess over towards Stoneface. Stoneface began to shake as the bag was moved closer to him; the ground around him began to vibrate and gently undulate with the power of his movements. \"Show me\" he said to Gabada. Gabada turned to Abujo awaiting further instruction but none came. Abujo once again spoke out, \"Master we will show you once we have been given our reward\". </p><p>\"So be it\" said Stoneface in an angry tone. \"Come to me then and you will receive your payment.\"</p><p>The body of the Princess was now only a short distance from the stone effigy; the three sorcerers made their way with shaking excitement towards the solemn looking Stoneface. They slowly linked their arms around him, their hands shaking as they did so, their eyes staring down awaiting their gift of immortality as promised. At first, there was nothing more than a cold silence that emanated forth from Stoneface; then all of a sudden his mouth-gaping wide as a huge sucking force came from between his lips. </p><p>The three sorcerers screamed out in fear and terror as they tried to move themselves away from now gaping maw of Stoneface; they were rapidly being pulled and sucked down towards his open mouth. They could not resist this enormous power of suction as it forced them to their knees.</p><p>\"Pray to me you retches!\" Stoneface screamed forth \"Pray!!!\"</p><p>The sorcerers shouted weakening incantations to Stoneface begging him to release them from this vortex; but instead, the sucking increased and they were dragged one by one into its rocky mouth.</p><p>Cracking bones and high pitched screams of the sorcerers could be heard throughout the woods of Shalia as Stoneface ground them into dust. After many minutes only silence reigned, once again serenity prevails. </p><p> </p>
