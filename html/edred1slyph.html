<p>ELDRED: 1. SLYPH</p><p>Standing upon the lush green slopes of the mountain of Zintai stood Prince Eldred. </p><p>Standing alone, his ice blue eyes were steadily fixed upon the bloody carnage taking place within the valley below. Today it was a valley of death, a valley which ran with rivers of crimson blood.</p><p>The Prince was dressed in armour which befitted his station, a lightweight armour that was more durable than any other in existence. It was trimmed with precious gold and enamelled across his chest in bright orange was the Eagle of Satori, his family crest of which he was so proud. </p><p>In his hand he held a sword of immense beauty. It had a handle of gold  finished with the head of a serpent at its hilt. A serpent which only he knew held a deadly surprise, for in the event of the Prince desiring it, he could open the serpent's mouth in an instant exposing two sharp fangs laced with poison that could render any assailant paralysed. This was not any ordinary poison for he had taken the precaution of giving it to his Father's magician Adjan. Adjan had spoken words of great magical power over the sword to ensure the poison would work on any person, mortal or immortal, human or demon.</p><p>The Princes' thoughts returned to the battle raging before him, his muscular body tightening, preparing for battle. As yet he had watched the battle from afar with his Father King Edwin and the other Lords but it was clear that soon he himself would be called to battle.  Scanning the distant horizon he could see the huge red star suspended above the majestic slopes of Zintai, flowing from it was a wave of enemy soldiers dressed in armour of blood red, he felt exhilarated. Whilst it would be the first time the Prince had gone into battle he was already a skilled fighter and was not unnerved by the sight of battle. He would soon have the honour of standing beside his father where they would defend the great Kingdom, fighting side by side.</p><p>Huge ravens hovered high above the scene, their orange eyes shining and glinting in the sunlight. Their powerful wings beating in a whirling frenzy as they swooped into battle themselves, pecking at the assailant's eyes with a fevered ferocity, for these were no ordinary birds of the sky, but ferocious hand reared pets the enemy's children.   The Prince quickly hated these flying beasts and couldn't wait to stamp the life out of their scrawny bodies. </p><p>Suddenly a great cry bellowed forth and a huge rumble ensued as the enemy readied themselves once again to advance, the birds perched on the soldier's shoulders twitching and fluttering in anticipation of a further thrust. Swords were drawn once again as the enemy began their fresh surge. </p><p>The forces of his father King Edwin moved forward to meet the menace before them, they were already battered and bloodied but resolutely stepped around severed heads and disfigured disembowelled corpses which were scattered around them, for the battle had already lasted several hours.</p><p>The King's eyes suddenly widened and shone with a blood lust as he turned to face his son. \"It is time; time to go down and deal the death blow to our enemy. We must be the ones that defeat those who would come and take our lands! We will kill them, parting their filthy heads from their vile bodies!\"</p><p>Prince Eldred nodded eagerly as they both ran toward the battlefield, he could not believe the stench of blood, faeces and sweat that filled the air yet it was mixed with something else, it was the tangible smell of fear. </p><p>Fear also gripped at his heart as he drew his beautiful sword readying himself to cleave the nearest enemy, to kill for the first time. He was hungry to prove himself to his father, he wanted his blade to taste the enemy's dirty blood.</p><p>Suddenly, a great wind whipped up around them. It was a strange wind which only affected them; the Prince through squinting eyes observed that the battle before them continued unhindered by this unearthly gust. The wind threw them around with ease lifting their feet from the ground and hurtling them back down again in an instant. Scared and confused they staggered forward towards the battle with their cloaks billowing in the great winds that tore at their bodies. The Prince began to slash out at the gusts of wind with his sword, for he believed that some kind of magic had been cast upon them by their enemy.  Prince Eldred screamed in anger and frustration as he and his father were pushed backwards by the sheer force of the winds.</p><p>A strange high pitched scream began to emanate from around them, it increased in intensity forcing them to drop their weapons and reach for their ears in a desperate attempt to try to block out the increasingly painful sound.</p><p>Even before their weapons had reached the bloodied ground, wind elementals that flashed silver and gold within the sunlight grasped at them, they held them with a steady sureness wielding them around their gleaming heads. Chanting in high pitched squeals of joy \"We are Slyph, we are Slyph, you must die!\".</p><p>With this the nearest elemental lashed out at the King with great power and speed. The King fell immediately, his head rolling down the hill in a haze of the brightest shade of crimson.  The Prince, still holding his ears, looked in disbelief as his father's head rolled and bumped down the slope towards the still raging battle. He was stunned only for a moment. As if cutting their way through a field of corn the elementals vigorously butchered the soldiers all around him, making them scream out in horror.  But these were silent screams, their mouths moved in anguish but their cries could not be heard above the  shrieking elementals. </p><p>The elementals then turned towards Prince Eldred their shapes whipping and whirling, twirling about him in gleaming patterns. He could sense they knew who he was and with a fresh burst of courage he reached for his trusty sword which had been taken by the elemental closest to his left shoulder. He somehow managed to grasp the blade which cut into his hand through his leather gauntlet as he tugged it from the iron grip of the elemental, the sword looked so beautiful as he flicked it over in one agile movement so that the handle was once again resting in his injured hand. </p><p>Before him drifting in the wind was an enormous dark coloured elemental, it stood out amongst the others due to its immense size and presence. Its face shone like a dark moon as it held outstretched a sword which resonated an immense power, a sword which possessed a blade that glowed with fire, the elemental swung it around its enormous bulbous  dark head. The Prince was mesmerised by the swords' beauty as it arced downwards with such force it slid straight through the Prince's sword like it was made from a brittle stick. The blade fell to the ground with a dull thud, leaving only its handle in his right hand. He felt almost instantaneously an excruciating pain emanating from his chest and looking down with horror, he recognised his chest was now gaping open, his breastplate in pieces and his ribs exposed. As he slowly began to comprehend what had happened to him, the elemental advanced once again, this time to finish the Prince once and for all.  But with his last remaining strength Prince Eldred managed to unveil the deadly secret which lay in his sword handle exposing the two fangs of the serpent. With all the remaining strength he could muster he plunged the fangs into the face of the grinning elemental in front of him.</p><p>A huge roar of such ferocity yet also surprise came from the great creature as its movements rapidly slowed. It began to fall, yet before it could hit the ground paralysed, the other elementals swooped around it lifting the being upwards gracefully towards the stars, rapidly disappearing in a gleaming funeral like procession towards the red star which hung above them. As it ascended the Prince saw the great sword still burning fall to the ground near to him. He was dying, but it was so beautiful, more beautiful than anything he had ever seen, even more beautiful than his own sword which was now destroyed.  He had to possess it, if even just for a moment. But as his hand reached for its hilt it slipped away from his grasp, and he then was aware of an enemy soldier standing over him. The last sensation was a slashing at his throat. With so much more blood and a huge war axe brought down on the remains of his chest, he knew no more.</p>
