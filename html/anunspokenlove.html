<p>AN UNSPOKEN LOVE</p><p>Love unspoken, unnamed, yet true. </p><p>Heart yearns, groping in darkness for a finger unfurled;</p><p>Her hand is there. </p><p>Softness and warmth, seeking fulfilment; </p><p>A touch, a glimmer of latent love emerges.  </p><p>At that delightful moment, a breath yet could be a thousand lifetimes;</p><p>A fire fairy deftly skipping and dancing making my fingers and spirit yearn. </p><p>An interlude of passion seeks to burn away a lifetime of monochrome sorrow, </p><p>If I let it.. Dare I let it?</p><p>My heart is warm, its soft fingers reaching out to embrace. </p><p>We hold hands, words are lost here, no longer needed but not forgotten. </p><p>Time drifts seamlessly but with purpose, </p><p>Hugging me warmly in this place of happiness.  </p><p>Dare I speak love, dare I let it warm my heart of stone?</p><p>Speak the gentle words of love, name it so! </p><p>My broken spirit enlivened with the small spark of immortality,</p><p>Becomes enriched with hopefulness. </p><p>Desperate embrace my hands eagerly searching to entwine </p><p>But she is gone. </p><p>A phantasm of my dreams sent to destroy. </p><p>Love flows from my broken heart, </p><p>My eyes downcast as I settle to a life-fallorn.</p><p> </p>
