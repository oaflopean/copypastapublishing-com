<p>BLIND PANIC</p><p>Lying on my back I wonder where I am. My body is heavy with sleep but strangely my mind has woken. I'm conscious, my bed is hard as a butcher's block and my bedroom unnaturally stuffy, I blink slowly and deliberately in an attempt to clear the heavy funk from my mind. It's so dark there's no sound from the cobbled street outside, the silence is distinctly palpable. I wonder what time it is. I turn my head to look for the bedroom wall clock but I can see and hear nothing, I rack my brain for an explanation but none appears. My mouth is so dry, what did I do last night? Snippets of somehow distant memories drift through my mind but nothing seems to make sense, nothing connects.  I turn my head toward my sleeping wife and quietly murmur \"I'm just getting a drink of water, back in a moment.\" I start to sit up and immediately THWACK!!!!!! \"ARGHHH!\" I bump my head on an unseen object immediately above my face, my cry somehow muffled. Blood  oozing from my broken nose, anxiety grips my chest. I cannot breathe...</p><p> </p><p>I explore the space immediately above my face, my fingertips greeted with the feel of polished wood. I call to my wife lying beside me, but no reply. I frantically search for her groping out to my right and my left, my fingers greeted again with richly polished wood this time through padded cloth. I kick my feet trying to explore below they find the same. I struggle to take a deep breath trying to fathom what is happening, I start screaming and shouting calling for my wife calling for anyone who could hear me! But all I could hear was the heavy sound of silence. I tried to think of what happened the previous day that may explain where I am now, fragments of memories disconnected; one though sticks in my mind, I remember my wife crying over me, I desperately try to remember why but the memories remain elusive. My heart beats faster and faster, I am shaking violently blood from my nose seeping into my mouth choking me.</p><p>\"Where am I ! Why am I here!\"</p><p>I try to think back for any clue, my mind hurts with the strain, I feel as if I slept for years. My eyes are dry, tears do not come, the feeling of claustrophobia is suffocating. There is little air, breathing is getting difficult, I am robbed of air my tongue too big for my mouth. Now I remember. Fragmented memories drift into view of being surrounded by doctor and nurses I remember being very ill my wife weeping her goodbye, I remember the icy grip of Death its suffocating fingers stealing my life's breath. I remember.</p><p>I realise where I am and start to claw at the coffin lid. Splinters lodge under my fingernails, I smell fresh blood. I kick at the lid hoping somehow to break free, but it does no good. I am screaming and shouting my very life depends upon it, I scream for my wife, begging for her to find me! My voice cracking growing quiet, the silence is deafening, breathing such an effort, harder and harder. Every breath a desperate attempt to cling to life.</p><p>My mind wanders and I start to dream no longer constrained by my grave, I float gently upwards through the ground, I notice my headstone 'Harry Rolting', yes that's right once I had been Harry. I dream of blue skies and open flower filled meadows. I see my wife and children far away calling to me in the distance, I am gently flying through the air. I reach my wife, my family I throw my arms around them. I hold them in my thoughts as my dream starts to fade, I stop breathing, I die a second death.</p>
